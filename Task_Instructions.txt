Your task is to classify bioRxiv abstracts by infectious disease type using deep learning or traditional NLP-based text classification methods.

What to do:
Collect a few bioRxiv abstracts using keywords such as “COVID-19”, “Dengue”, and “Tuberculosis”, and train a model to classify which disease each abstract belongs to.

Steps:

Collect around 50–100 abstracts manually or using the bioRxiv API or web scraping.
Preprocess the text (tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization).
Use TF-IDF + Logistic Regression or a Transformer-based model (like BERT or SciBERT) for classification.
Train and evaluate the model performance.
Expected Output:

Confusion matrix showing class-level performance.
Accuracy score of your classifier.
