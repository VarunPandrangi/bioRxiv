10.1101/058511,Respiratory physiological perturbations after acute smoke-induced lung injury and during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support in sheep,"BackgroundNumerous successful therapies developed for human medicine involve animal experimentation. Animal studies that are focused solely on translational potential, may not sufficiently document unexpected outcomes. Considerable amounts of data from such studies could be used to advance veterinary science. For example, sheep are increasingly being used as models of intensive care and therefore, data arising from such models must be published. In this study, the hypothesis is that there is little information describing cardiorespiratory physiological data from sheep models of intensive care and the author aimed to analyse such data to provide biological information that is currently not available for sheep that received extracorporeal life support (ECLS) following acute smoke-induced lung injury.

MethodsNineteen mechanically ventilated adult ewes undergoing intensive care during evaluation of a form of ECLS (treatment) for acute lung injury were used to collate clinical observations. Eight sheep were injured by acute smoke inhalation prior to treatment (injured/treated), while another eight were not injured but treated (uninjured/treated). Two sheep were injured but not treated (injured/untreated), while one received room air instead of smoke as the injury and was not treated (placebo/untreated). The data were then analysed for 11 physiological categories and compared between the two treated groups.

ResultsCompared with the baseline, treatment contributed to and exacerbated the deterioration of pulmonary pathology by reducing lung compliance and the arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio. The oxygen extraction index changes mirrored those of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Decreasing coronary perfusion pressure predicted the severity of cardiopulmonary injury.

ConclusionsThese novel observations could help in understanding similar pathology such as that which occurs in animal victims of smoke inhalation from house or bush fires, aspiration pneumonia secondary to tick paralysis and in the management of the severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans.",2020-06-13,scientific communication and education,COVID-19,COVID-19,backgroundnumerous successful therapies developed for human medicine involve animal experimentation animal studies that are focused solely on translational potential may not sufficiently document unexpected outcomes considerable amounts of data from such studies could be used to advance veterinary science for example sheep are increasingly being used as models of intensive care and therefore data arising from such models must be published in this study the hypothesis is that there is little information describing cardiorespiratory physiological data from sheep models of intensive care and the author aimed to analyse such data to provide biological information that is currently not available for sheep that received extracorporeal life support ecls following acute smoke induced lung injury methodsnineteen mechanically ventilated adult ewes undergoing intensive care during evaluation of a form of ecls treatment for acute lung injury were used to collate clinical observations eight sheep were injured by acute smoke inhalation prior to treatment injured treated while another eight were not injured but treated uninjured treated two sheep were injured but not treated injured untreated while one received room air instead of smoke as the injury and was not treated placebo untreated the data were then analysed for physiological categories and compared between the two treated groups resultscompared with the baseline treatment contributed to and exacerbated the deterioration of pulmonary pathology by reducing lung compliance and the arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen pao fio ratio the oxygen extraction index changes mirrored those of the pao fio ratio decreasing coronary perfusion pressure predicted the severity of cardiopulmonary injury conclusionsthese novel observations could help in understanding similar pathology such as that which occurs in animal victims of smoke inhalation from house or bush fires aspiration pneumonia secondary to tick paralysis and in the management of the severe coronavirus disease covid in humans,backgroundnumerous successful therapy develop human medicine involve animal experimentation animal study focus solely translational potential may sufficiently document unexpected outcome considerable amount data study could use advance veterinary science example sheep increasingly use model intensive care therefore datum arise model must publish study hypothesis little information describe cardiorespiratory physiological datum sheep model intensive care author aim analyse datum provide biological information currently available sheep receive extracorporeal life support ecls follow acute smoke induce lung injury methodsnineteen mechanically ventilate adult ewe undergo intensive care evaluation form ecls treatment acute lung injury use collate clinical observation eight sheep injure acute smoke inhalation prior treatment injure treat another eight injure treat uninjured treat two sheep injure treat injured untreated one receive room air instead smoke injury treat placebo untreated datum analyse physiological category compare two treat group resultscompare baseline treatment contribute exacerbate deterioration pulmonary pathology reduce lung compliance arterial oxygen partial pressure fractional inspire oxygen pao fio ratio oxygen extraction index change mirror pao fio ratio decrease coronary perfusion pressure predict severity cardiopulmonary injury conclusionsthese novel observation could help understand similar pathology occur animal victim smoke inhalation house bush fires aspiration pneumonia secondary tick paralysis management severe coronavirus disease covid human
10.1101/292979,Manipulation of the unfolded protein response: a pharmacological strategy against coronavirus infection,"Coronavirus infection induces the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular signalling pathway composed of three branches, triggered by unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due to high ER load. We have used RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling to investigate holistically the transcriptional and translational response to cellular infection by murine hepatitis virus (MHV), often used as a model for the Betacoronavirus genus to which the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 also belongs. We found the UPR to be amongst the most significantly up-regulated pathways in response to MHV infection. To confirm and extend these observations, we show experimentally the induction of all three branches of the UPR in both MHV- and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Over-expression of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 or S proteins alone is itself sufficient to induce the UPR. Remarkably, pharmacological inhibition of the UPR greatly reduced the replication of both MHV and SARS-CoV-2, revealing the importance of this pathway for successful coronavirus replication. This was particularly striking when both IRE1 and ATF6 branches of the UPR were inhibited, reducing SARS-CoV-2 virion release [~]1,000-fold. Together, these data highlight the UPR as a promising antiviral target to combat coronavirus infection.

Author SummarySARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic which has resulted in over 100 million cases since the end of 2019. Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without any special treatment. However, older people, and those with underlying medical problems like chronic respiratory disease are more likely to develop a serious illness. So far, more than 2 million people have died of COVID-19. Unfortunately, there is no specific medication for this viral disease.

In order to produce viral proteins and to replicate their genetic information, all coronaviruses use a cellular structure known as the endoplasmic reticulum or ER. However, the massive production and modification of viral proteins stresses the ER and this activates a compensatory cellular response that tries to reduce ER protein levels. This is termed the unfolded protein response or UPR. We believe that coronaviruses take advantage of the activation of the UPR to enhance their replication.

The UPR is also activated in some types of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders and UPR inhibitor drugs have been developed to tackle these diseases. In this work, we have tested some of these compounds in human lung cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and found that virus production was reduced 1000-fold in human lung cells.",2021-03-19,microbiology,COVID-19,COVID-19,coronavirus infection induces the unfolded protein response upr a cellular signalling pathway composed of three branches triggered by unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum er due to high er load we have used rna sequencing and ribosome profiling to investigate holistically the transcriptional and translational response to cellular infection by murine hepatitis virus mhv often used as a model for the betacoronavirus genus to which the recently emerged sars cov also belongs we found the upr to be amongst the most significantly up regulated pathways in response to mhv infection to confirm and extend these observations we show experimentally the induction of all three branches of the upr in both mhv and sars cov infected cells over expression of the sars cov orf or s proteins alone is itself sufficient to induce the upr remarkably pharmacological inhibition of the upr greatly reduced the replication of both mhv and sars cov revealing the importance of this pathway for successful coronavirus replication this was particularly striking when both ire and atf branches of the upr were inhibited reducing sars cov virion release fold together these data highlight the upr as a promising antiviral target to combat coronavirus infection author summarysars cov is the novel coronavirus responsible for the covid pandemic which has resulted in over million cases since the end of most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without any special treatment however older people and those with underlying medical problems like chronic respiratory disease are more likely to develop a serious illness so far more than million people have died of covid unfortunately there is no specific medication for this viral disease in order to produce viral proteins and to replicate their genetic information all coronaviruses use a cellular structure known as the endoplasmic reticulum or er however the massive production and modification of viral proteins stresses the er and this activates a compensatory cellular response that tries to reduce er protein levels this is termed the unfolded protein response or upr we believe that coronaviruses take advantage of the activation of the upr to enhance their replication the upr is also activated in some types of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders and upr inhibitor drugs have been developed to tackle these diseases in this work we have tested some of these compounds in human lung cells infected with sars cov and found that virus production was reduced fold in human lung cells,coronavirus infection induce unfold protein response upr cellular signal pathway compose three branch trigger unfold protein endoplasmic reticulum due high load use rna sequence ribosome profiling investigate holistically transcriptional translational response cellular infection murine hepatitis virus mhv often use model betacoronavirus genus recently emerge sar cov also belong find upr amongst significantly regulated pathway response mhv infection confirm extend observation show experimentally induction three branch upr mhv sar cov infect cell expression sar cov orf protein alone sufficient induce upr remarkably pharmacological inhibition upr greatly reduce replication mhv sar cov reveal importance pathway successful coronavirus replication particularly strike ire atf branch upr inhibit reduce sar cov virion release fold together datum highlight upr promise antiviral target combat coronavirus infection author summarysar cov novel coronavirus responsible covid pandemic result million case since end people infect virus experience mild moderate respiratory illness recover without special treatment however old people underlie medical problem like chronic respiratory disease likely develop serious illness far million people die covid unfortunately specific medication viral disease order produce viral protein replicate genetic information coronaviruse use cellular structure know endoplasmic reticulum however massive production modification viral protein stress activate compensatory cellular response try reduce protein level term unfold protein response upr believe coronaviruse take advantage activation upr enhance replication upr also activate type cancer neurodegenerative disorder upr inhibitor drug develop tackle disease work test compound human lung cell infect sar cov find virus production reduce fold human lung cell
10.1101/663930,The Cellular Immunity Agent Based Model (CIABM): Replicating the cellular immune response to viral respiratory infection,"Viral respiratory infections, such as influenza, result in over 1 million deaths worldwide each year. To date, there are few therapeutic interventions able to affect the course of the disease once acquired, a deficit with stark consequences that were readily evident in the current COVID-19 pandemic. We present the Cellular Immune Agent Based Model (CIABM) as a flexible framework for modeling acute viral infection and cellular immune memory development. The mechanism/rule-based nature of the CIABM allows for interrogation of the complex dynamics of the human immune system during various types of viral infections. The CIABM is an extension of a prior agent-based model of the innate immune response, incorporating additional cellular types and mediators involved in the response to viral infection. The CIABM simulates the dynamics of viral respiratory infection in terms of epithelial invasion, immune cellular population changes and cytokine measurements. Validation of the CIABM involved effectively replicating in vivo measurements of circulating mediator levels from a clinical cohort of influenza patients. The general purpose nature of the CIABM allows for both the representation of various types of known viral infections and facilitates the exploration of hypothetical, novel viral pathogens.",2020-08-26,immunology,COVID-19,COVID-19,viral respiratory infections such as influenza result in over million deaths worldwide each year to date there are few therapeutic interventions able to affect the course of the disease once acquired a deficit with stark consequences that were readily evident in the current covid pandemic we present the cellular immune agent based model ciabm as a flexible framework for modeling acute viral infection and cellular immune memory development the mechanism rule based nature of the ciabm allows for interrogation of the complex dynamics of the human immune system during various types of viral infections the ciabm is an extension of a prior agent based model of the innate immune response incorporating additional cellular types and mediators involved in the response to viral infection the ciabm simulates the dynamics of viral respiratory infection in terms of epithelial invasion immune cellular population changes and cytokine measurements validation of the ciabm involved effectively replicating in vivo measurements of circulating mediator levels from a clinical cohort of influenza patients the general purpose nature of the ciabm allows for both the representation of various types of known viral infections and facilitates the exploration of hypothetical novel viral pathogens,viral respiratory infection influenza result million death worldwide year date therapeutic intervention able affect course disease acquire deficit stark consequence readily evident current covid pandemic present cellular immune agent base model ciabm flexible framework model acute viral infection cellular immune memory development mechanism rule base nature ciabm allow interrogation complex dynamic human immune system various type viral infection ciabm extension prior agent base model innate immune response incorporate additional cellular type mediator involve response viral infection ciabm simulate dynamic viral respiratory infection term epithelial invasion immune cellular population change cytokine measurement validation ciabm involve effectively replicate vivo measurement circulate mediator level clinical cohort influenza patient general purpose nature ciabm allow representation various type know viral infection facilitate exploration hypothetical novel viral pathogen
10.1101/711929,Detecting regions of differential abundance betweenscRNA-Seq datasets,"Traditional cell clustering analysis used to compare the transcriptomic landscapes between two biological states in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is largely inadequate to functionally identify distinct and important differentially abundant (DA) subpopulations between groups. This problem is exacerbated further when using unsupervised clustering approaches where differences are not observed in clear cluster structure and therefore many important differences between two biological states go entirely unseen. Here, we develop DA-seq, a powerful unbiased, multi-scale algorithm that uniquely detects and decodes novel DA subpopulations not restricted to well separated clusters or known cell types. We apply DA-seq to several publicly available scRNA-seq datasets on various biological systems to detect differences between distinct phenotype in COVID-19 cases, melanomas subjected to immune checkpoint therapy, embryonic development and aging brain, as well as simulated data. Importantly, we find that DA-seq not only recovers the DA cell types as discovered in the original studies, but also reveals new DA subpopulations that were not described before. Analysis of these novel subpopulations yields new biological insights that would otherwise be neglected.",2020-03-18,bioinformatics,COVID-19,COVID-19,traditional cell clustering analysis used to compare the transcriptomic landscapes between two biological states in single cell rna sequencing scrna seq is largely inadequate to functionally identify distinct and important differentially abundant da subpopulations between groups this problem is exacerbated further when using unsupervised clustering approaches where differences are not observed in clear cluster structure and therefore many important differences between two biological states go entirely unseen here we develop da seq a powerful unbiased multi scale algorithm that uniquely detects and decodes novel da subpopulations not restricted to well separated clusters or known cell types we apply da seq to several publicly available scrna seq datasets on various biological systems to detect differences between distinct phenotype in covid cases melanomas subjected to immune checkpoint therapy embryonic development and aging brain as well as simulated data importantly we find that da seq not only recovers the da cell types as discovered in the original studies but also reveals new da subpopulations that were not described before analysis of these novel subpopulations yields new biological insights that would otherwise be neglected,traditional cell cluster analysis use compare transcriptomic landscape two biological state single cell rna sequence scrna seq largely inadequate functionally identify distinct important differentially abundant subpopulation group problem exacerbate use unsupervised clustering approach difference observe clear cluster structure therefore many important difference two biological state entirely unseen develop seq powerful unbiased multi scale algorithm uniquely detect decode novel subpopulation restrict well separate cluster know cell type apply seq several publicly available scrna seq dataset various biological system detect difference distinct phenotype covid case melanomas subject immune checkpoint therapy embryonic development age brain well simulate datum importantly find seq recover cell type discover original study also reveal new subpopulation describe analysis novel subpopulation yield new biological insight would otherwise neglect
10.1101/833418,Linear B-cell epitope prediction for in silico vaccine design: a performance review of methods available via command-line interface,"Linear B-cell epitope prediction research has received a steadily growing interest ever since the first method was developed in 1981. B-cell epitope identification with the help of an accurate prediction method can lead to an overall faster and cheaper vaccine design process, a crucial necessity in the covid-19 era. Consequently, several B-cell epitope prediction methods have been developed over the past few decades, but without significant success. In this study, we review the current performance and methodology of some of the most widely used linear B-cell epitope predictors which are available via a command-line interface, namely BcePred, BepiPred, ABCpred, COBEpro, SVMTriP, LBtope, and LBEEP. Additionally, we attempted to remedy performance issues of the individual methods by developing a consensus classifier, which combines the separate predictions of these methods into a single output, accelerating the epitope-based vaccine design. While the method comparison was performed with some necessary caveats and individual methods might perform much better for specialized datasets, we hope that this update in performance can aid researchers towards the choice of a predictor, for the development of biomedical applications such as designed vaccines, diagnostic kits, immunotherapeutics, immunodiagnostic tests, antibody production, and disease diagnosis and therapy.",2021-03-13,bioinformatics,COVID-19,COVID-19,linear b cell epitope prediction research has received a steadily growing interest ever since the first method was developed in b cell epitope identification with the help of an accurate prediction method can lead to an overall faster and cheaper vaccine design process a crucial necessity in the covid era consequently several b cell epitope prediction methods have been developed over the past few decades but without significant success in this study we review the current performance and methodology of some of the most widely used linear b cell epitope predictors which are available via a command line interface namely bcepred bepipred abcpred cobepro svmtrip lbtope and lbeep additionally we attempted to remedy performance issues of the individual methods by developing a consensus classifier which combines the separate predictions of these methods into a single output accelerating the epitope based vaccine design while the method comparison was performed with some necessary caveats and individual methods might perform much better for specialized datasets we hope that this update in performance can aid researchers towards the choice of a predictor for the development of biomedical applications such as designed vaccines diagnostic kits immunotherapeutics immunodiagnostic tests antibody production and disease diagnosis and therapy,linear cell epitope prediction research receive steadily grow interest ever since first method develop cell epitope identification help accurate prediction method lead overall fast cheap vaccine design process crucial necessity covid era consequently several cell epitope prediction method develop past decade without significant success study review current performance methodology widely use linear cell epitope predictor available via command line interface namely bcepre bepipred abcpre cobepro svmtrip lbtope lbeep additionally attempt remedy performance issue individual method develop consensus classifier combine separate prediction method single output accelerate epitope base vaccine design method comparison perform necessary caveat individual method might perform much well specialize dataset hope update performance aid researcher towards choice predictor development biomedical application design vaccine diagnostic kit immunotherapeutic immunodiagnostic test antibody production disease diagnosis therapy
10.1101/2020.01.15.907873,The WD and linker domains of ATG16L1 required for non canonical autophagy limit lethal influenza A virus infection at epithelial surfaces.,"Respiratory viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV) and SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) cause pandemic infections where cytokine storm syndrome, lung inflammation and pneumonia lead to high mortality. Given the high social and economic cost of these viruses, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive understanding of how the airways defend against virus infection. Viruses entering cells by endocytosis are killed when delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Lysosome delivery is facilitated by non-canonical autophagy pathways that conjugate LC3 to endo-lysosome compartments to enhance lysosome fusion. Here we use mice lacking the WD and linker domains of ATG16L1 to demonstrate that non-canonical autophagy protects mice from lethal IAV infection of the airways. Mice with systemic loss of non-canonical autophagy are exquisitely sensitive to low-pathogenicity murine-adapted IAV where extensive viral replication throughout the lungs, coupled with cytokine amplification mediated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, leads to fulminant pneumonia, lung inflammation and high mortality. IAV infection was controlled within epithelial barriers where non-canonical autophagy slowed fusion of IAV with endosomes and reduced activation of interferon signalling. This was consistent with conditional mouse models and ex vivo analysis showing that protection against IAV infection of lung was independent of phagocytes and other leukocytes. This establishes non-canonical autophagy pathways in airway epithelial cells as a novel innate defence mechanism that can restrict IAV infection and lethal inflammation at respiratory surfaces.",2020-01-15,microbiology,COVID-19,COVID-19,respiratory viruses such as influenza a virus iav and sars cov covid cause pandemic infections where cytokine storm syndrome lung inflammation and pneumonia lead to high mortality given the high social and economic cost of these viruses there is an urgent need for a comprehensive understanding of how the airways defend against virus infection viruses entering cells by endocytosis are killed when delivered to lysosomes for degradation lysosome delivery is facilitated by non canonical autophagy pathways that conjugate lc to endo lysosome compartments to enhance lysosome fusion here we use mice lacking the wd and linker domains of atg l to demonstrate that non canonical autophagy protects mice from lethal iav infection of the airways mice with systemic loss of non canonical autophagy are exquisitely sensitive to low pathogenicity murine adapted iav where extensive viral replication throughout the lungs coupled with cytokine amplification mediated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells leads to fulminant pneumonia lung inflammation and high mortality iav infection was controlled within epithelial barriers where non canonical autophagy slowed fusion of iav with endosomes and reduced activation of interferon signalling this was consistent with conditional mouse models and ex vivo analysis showing that protection against iav infection of lung was independent of phagocytes and other leukocytes this establishes non canonical autophagy pathways in airway epithelial cells as a novel innate defence mechanism that can restrict iav infection and lethal inflammation at respiratory surfaces,respiratory virus influenza virus iav sars cov covid cause pandemic infection cytokine storm syndrome lung inflammation pneumonia lead high mortality give high social economic cost virus urgent need comprehensive understanding airways defend virus infection virus enter cell endocytosis kill deliver lysosome degradation lysosome delivery facilitate non canonical autophagy pathways conjugate endo lysosome compartment enhance lysosome fusion use mouse lack linker domain atg demonstrate non canonical autophagy protect mouse lethal iav infection airway mice systemic loss non canonical autophagy exquisitely sensitive low pathogenicity murine adapt iav extensive viral replication throughout lung couple cytokine amplification mediate plasmacytoid dendritic cell lead fulminant pneumonia lung inflammation high mortality iav infection control within epithelial barrier non canonical autophagy slow fusion iav endosome reduce activation interferon signal consistent conditional mouse model vivo analysis show protection iav infection lung independent phagocyte leukocyte establish non canonical autophagy pathway airway epithelial cell novel innate defence mechanism restrict iav infection lethal inflammation respiratory surface

Recent emerging viral threats including Zika, Ebola, and the current COVID-19 outbreak highlight the cost and difficulty in responding rapidly. To address these challenges, we develop a platform for low-cost and rapid detection of viral RNA with DNA nanoswitches designed to mechanically reconfigure in response to specific viruses. Using Zika virus as a model system, we show non-enzymatic detection of viral RNA to the attomole level, with selective and multiplexed detection between related viruses and viral strains. For clinical-level sensitivity in biological fluids, we paired the assay with a sample preparation step using either RNA extraction or isothermal pre-amplification. Our assay can be performed with minimal or no lab infrastructure, and is readily adaptable to detect other viruses.

Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. Further, we develop a suite of interpretability tools and show that it can be applied also to other models beyond the host prediction task. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision.

10.1101/2020.01.31.929695,Molecular Modeling Evaluation of the Binding Abilities of Ritonavir and Lopinavir to Wuhan Pneumonia Coronavirus Proteases,"Three anti-HIV drugs, ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir, might have therapeutic effect on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, the structure models of two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteases, coronavirus endopeptidase C30 (CEP_C30) and papain like viral protease (PLVP), were built by homology modeling. Ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir were then docked to the models, respectively, followed by energy minimization of the protease-drug complexes. In the simulations, ritonavir can bind to CEP_C30 most suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; lopinavir can also bind to CEP_C30 suitably, and induce significant conformation changes of CEP_C30; darunavir can bind to PLVP suitably with slight conformation changes of PLVP. It is suggested that the therapeutic effect of ritonavir and lopinavir on COVID-19 may be mainly due to their inhibitory effect on CEP_C30, while ritonavir may have stronger efficacy; the inhibitory effect of darunavir on SARS-CoV-2 and its potential therapeutic effect may be mainly due to its inhibitory effect on PLVP.",2020-02-03,biochemistry,COVID-19,COVID-19,three anti hiv drugs ritonavir lopinavir and darunavir might have therapeutic effect on coronavirus disease covid in this study the structure models of two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov proteases coronavirus endopeptidase c cep c and papain like viral protease plvp were built by homology modeling ritonavir lopinavir and darunavir were then docked to the models respectively followed by energy minimization of the protease drug complexes in the simulations ritonavir can bind to cep c most suitably and induce significant conformation changes of cep c lopinavir can also bind to cep c suitably and induce significant conformation changes of cep c darunavir can bind to plvp suitably with slight conformation changes of plvp it is suggested that the therapeutic effect of ritonavir and lopinavir on covid may be mainly due to their inhibitory effect on cep c while ritonavir may have stronger efficacy the inhibitory effect of darunavir on sars cov and its potential therapeutic effect may be mainly due to its inhibitory effect on plvp,three anti hiv drug ritonavir lopinavir darunavir might therapeutic effect coronavirus disease covid study structure model two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sar cov protease coronavirus endopeptidase cep papain like viral protease plvp build homology model ritonavir lopinavir darunavir dock model respectively follow energy minimization protease drug complex simulation ritonavir bind cep suitably induce significant conformation change cep lopinavir also bind cep suitably induce significant conformation change cep darunavir bind plvp suitably slight conformation change plvp suggest therapeutic effect ritonavir lopinavir covid may mainly due inhibitory effect cep ritonavir may strong efficacy inhibitory effect darunavir sar cov potential therapeutic effect may mainly due inhibitory effect plvp
10.1101/2020.02.03.932350,Machine learning-based analysis of genomes suggests associations between Wuhan 2019-nCoV and bat Betacoronaviruses,"As of February 20, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (renamed to COVID-19) spread to 30 countries with 2130 deaths and more than 75500 confirmed cases. COVID-19 is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus, which resulted, between November 2002 and July 2003, in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Though COVID-19 has a death rate of 2.8% as of 20 February, the 75752 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 20, 2020) are alarming, with cases likely being under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearmans rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation.

There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China.

Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a ""public-health emergency of international concern"" due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus the objective of this study is to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using immunoinformatics approach.

MethodSeveral techniques facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target.

ResultsExtensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in COVID-19 strain. Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively.

10.1101/2020.02.05.935387,Teicoplanin potently blocks the cell entry of 2019-nCoV,"Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the public health worldwide has been greatly threatened. The development of an effective treatment for this infection is crucial and urgent but is hampered by the incomplete understanding of the viral infection mechanism and the lack of specific antiviral agents. We previously reported that teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic that has been commonly used in the clinic to treat bacterial infection, significantly restrained the cell entry of Ebola virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by specifically inhibiting the activity of cathepsin L (CTSL). Here, we found that the cleavage sites of CTSL on the Spike of SARS-CoV-2 were highly conserved among all the variants. The treatment with teicoplanin suppressed the proteolytic activity of CTSL on Spike and prevented the cellular infection of different pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Teicoplanin potently prevented the entry of authentic SARS-CoV-2 into the cellular cytoplasm with an IC50 of 2.038 M for the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain and an IC50 of 2.116 M for the SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) variant. The pre-treatment of teicoplanin also prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2 mice. In summary, our data reveal that CTSL is required for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of teicoplanin for universal anti-CoVs intervention.

ImportanceDisease prevention and treatment are two important countermeasures to end the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, evolves all the time, resulting in the emerging of many epidemic SARS-CoV-2 mutants, which significantly impairs the effectiveness of early strain-based vaccines and antibodies. Developing universal vaccines and broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are essential to confront SARS-CoV-2 mutants including those may emerge in the future. Our study reported here showed that the cleavage sites of cellular cathepsin L (CTSL) are highly conserved among all the SARS-CoV-2 mutants and SARS-CoV. The CTSL inhibitor teicoplanin not only inhibited the cell entry of two live SARS-CoV-2 strains and various pseudotyped viruses but also prevented live virus infection in animal models. Based on our previous finding that teicoplanin also inhibited SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection, we believe that teicoplanin possesses the potential to become a universal anti-CoVs drug.",2020-02-13,microbiology,COVID-19,COVID-19,since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease covid caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov the public health worldwide has been greatly threatened the development of an effective treatment for this infection is crucial and urgent but is hampered by the incomplete understanding of the viral infection mechanism and the lack of specific antiviral agents we previously reported that teicoplanin a glycopeptide antibiotic that has been commonly used in the clinic to treat bacterial infection significantly restrained the cell entry of ebola virus sars cov and mers cov by specifically inhibiting the activity of cathepsin l ctsl here we found that the cleavage sites of ctsl on the spike of sars cov were highly conserved among all the variants the treatment with teicoplanin suppressed the proteolytic activity of ctsl on spike and prevented the cellular infection of different pseudotyped sars cov viruses teicoplanin potently prevented the entry of authentic sars cov into the cellular cytoplasm with an ic of m for the wuhan hu reference strain and an ic of m for the sars cov d g variant the pre treatment of teicoplanin also prevented sars cov infection in hace mice in summary our data reveal that ctsl is required for both sars cov and sars cov infection and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of teicoplanin for universal anti covs intervention importancedisease prevention and treatment are two important countermeasures to end the coronavirus disease covid however severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov the causative agent of covid evolves all the time resulting in the emerging of many epidemic sars cov mutants which significantly impairs the effectiveness of early strain based vaccines and antibodies developing universal vaccines and broad spectrum antiviral drugs are essential to confront sars cov mutants including those may emerge in the future our study reported here showed that the cleavage sites of cellular cathepsin l ctsl are highly conserved among all the sars cov mutants and sars cov the ctsl inhibitor teicoplanin not only inhibited the cell entry of two live sars cov strains and various pseudotyped viruses but also prevented live virus infection in animal models based on our previous finding that teicoplanin also inhibited sars cov and mers cov infection we believe that teicoplanin possesses the potential to become a universal anti covs drug,since outbreak coronavirus disease covid cause severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sar cov public health worldwide greatly threaten development effective treatment infection crucial urgent hamper incomplete understand viral infection mechanism lack specific antiviral agent previously report teicoplanin glycopeptide antibiotic commonly use clinic treat bacterial infection significantly restrain cell entry ebola virus sar cov mer cov specifically inhibit activity cathepsin ctsl find cleavage site ctsl spike sar cov highly conserve among variant treatment teicoplanin suppress proteolytic activity ctsl spike prevent cellular infection different pseudotype sar cov virus teicoplanin potently prevent entry authentic sar cov cellular cytoplasm wuhan reference strain sars cov variant pre treatment teicoplanin also prevent sar cov infection hace mice summary datum reveal ctsl require sar cov sar cov infection demonstrate therapeutic potential teicoplanin universal anti covs intervention importancedisease prevention treatment two important countermeasure end coronavirus disease covid however severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sar cov causative agent covid evolve time result emerge many epidemic sar cov mutant significantly impairs effectiveness early strain base vaccine antibodie develop universal vaccine broad spectrum antiviral drug essential confront sar cov mutant include may emerge future study report show cleavage site cellular cathepsin ctsl highly conserve among sar cov mutant sar cov ctsl inhibitor teicoplanin inhibit cell entry two live sar cov strain various pseudotype virus also prevent live virus infection animal model base previous finding teicoplanin also inhibit sar cov mer cov infection believe teicoplanin possess potential become universal anti covs drug

10.1101/2020.02.19.956946,Structural basis for the recognition of the 2019-nCoV by human ACE2,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been suggested to be the cellular receptor for the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that is causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Like other coronaviruses such as the SARS-CoV, the 2019-nCoV uses the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) to engage ACE2. We most recently determined the structure of the full-length human ACE2 in complex with a neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 bound to the RBD of the 2019-nCoV at an overall resolution of 2.9 [A] in the presence of B0AT1. The local resolution at the ACE2-RBD interface is 3.5 [A], allowing analysis of the detailed interactions between the RBD and the receptor. Similar to that for the SARS-CoV, the RBD of the 2019-nCoV is recognized by the extracellular peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2 mainly through polar residues.

10.1101/2020.02.19.955484,Potential T-cell and B-cell Epitopes of 2019-nCoV,"As of early March, 2019-nCoV has infected more than one hundred thousand people and claimed thousands of lives. 2019-nCoV is a novel form of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and has high similarity with SARS-CoV. No approved vaccine yet exists for any form of coronavirus. Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing B-cell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain. Based on these findings, the spike protein is likely immunogenic and a potential vaccine candidate. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV experimental data.

Significance StatementThe novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has affected more than 100 countries and continues to spread. There is an immediate need for effective vaccines that contain antigens which trigger responses from human T-cells and B-cells (known as epitopes). Here we identify potential T-cell epitopes through an analysis of human antigen presentation, as well as B-cell epitopes through an analysis of protein structure.

10.1101/2020.02.22.951178,Spike protein binding prediction with neutralizing antibodies of SARS-CoV-2,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new emerging human infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also previously known as 2019-nCoV), originated in Wuhan seafood and animal market, China. Since December 2019, more than 69,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China and quickly spreads to other counties. Currently, researchers put their best efforts to identify effective drugs for COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. In this study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Sipke (S) protein and interfere with the interaction between viral S protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. The sequence analysis of S protein showed two major differences in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV related bat viruses (btSARS-CoV). The insertion regions were close to interacting residues with the human ACE2 receptor. Epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the {beta}-sheet structure in MERS-CoV S protein and deleted in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To identify effective neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, the binding affinities of neutralizing antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 S protein were predicted and compared by antibody-antigen docking simulation. The result showed that CR3022 neutralizing antibody from human may have higher binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than SARS-CoV S protein. We also found that F26G19 and D12 mouse antibodies could bind to SARS-CoV S protein with high affinity.

Although RT-PCR-based molecular diagnosis techniques are being widely applied for clinical diagnosis currently, timely and accurate diagnosis are still limited due to labour intensive and time-consuming operations of these techniques. To address the issue, herein we report the synthesis of poly (amino ester) with carboxyl groups (PC)-coated magnetic nanoparticles (pcMNPs), and the development of pcMNPs-based viral RNA extraction method for the sensitive detection of COVID-19 causing virus, the SARS-CoV-2. This method combines the lysis and binding steps into one step, and the pcMNPs-RNA complexes can be directly introduced into subsequent RT-PCR reactions. The simplified process can purify viral RNA from multiple samples within 20 min using a simple manual method or an automated high-throughput approach. By identifying two different regions (ORFlab and N gene) of viral RNA, a 10-copy sensitivity and a strong linear correlation between 10 and 105 copies of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles are achieved.

10.1101/2020.02.25.963546,An Effective CTL Peptide Vaccine for Ebola Zaire Based on Survivors' CD8+ Targeting of a Particular Nucleocapsid Protein Epitope with Potential Implications for COVID-19 Vaccine Design,The 2013-2016 West Africa EBOV epidemic was the biggest EBOV outbreak to date. An analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in 30 survivors showed that 26 of those individuals had a CD8+ response to at least one EBOV protein. The dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire. We show that a 9-amino-acid peptide NP44-52 (YQVNNLEEI) located in a conserved region of EBOV NP provides protection against morbidity and mortality after mouse adapted EBOV challenge. A single vaccination in a C57BL/6 mouse using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine formulation containing NP44-52 is enough to confer immunity in mice. Our work suggests that a peptide vaccine based on CD8+ T-cell immunity in EBOV survivors is conceptually sound and feasible. Nucleocapsid proteins within SARS-CoV-2 contain multiple class I epitopes with predicted HLA restrictions consistent with broad population coverage.

Currently there is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (Mpro). Mpro is a key CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus5,6. Here, we identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal structure of COVID-19 virus Mpro in complex with this compound. Next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these inhibit Mpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 M. Ebselen also exhibited promising antiviral activity in cell-based assays.

Till date, no vaccine or completely effective drug is available to cure COVID-19. Therefore, an effective vaccine against SARS-COV-2 is crucially needed. This study was conducted to design an effective multiepitope based vaccine (MEV) against SARS-COV-2. Seven antigenic proteins were taken as targets and different epitopes (B-cell, T-cell and IFN-{gamma} inducing) were predicted. Highly antigenic and overlapping epitopes were shortlisted. Selected epitopes indicated significant interactions with the HLA-binding alleles and 99.29% coverage of the worlds population. Finally, 505 amino acids long MEV was designed by connecting sixteen MHC class I and eleven MHC class II epitopes with suitable linkers and adjuvant. Linkers and adjuvant were added to enhance the immunogenicity response of the MEV. The antigenicity, allergenicity, physiochemical properties and structural details of MEV were analyzed in order to ensure safety and immunogenicity. MEV construct was non-allergenic, antigenic, stable and flexible. Molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis, demonstrated a stable and strong binding affinity of MEV with human pathogenic toll-like receptors (TLR), TLR3 and TLR8. Codon optimization and in silico cloning of MEV ensured increased expression in the Escherichia coli K-12 system.

10.1101/2020.02.27.968008,Molecular Dynamics Simulations Indicate the COVID-19 Mpro Is Not a Viable Target for Small-Molecule Inhibitors Design,"The novel coronavirus whose outbreak took place in December 2019 continues to spread at a rapid rate worldwide. In the absence of an effective vaccine, inhibitor repurposing or de novo drug design may offer a longer-term strategy to combat this and future infections due to similar viruses. Here, we report on detailed classical and mix-solvent molecular dynamics simulations of the main protease (Mpro) enriched by evolutionary and stability analysis of the protein. The results were compared with those for a highly similar SARS Mpro protein. In spite of a high level of sequence similarity, the active sites in both proteins show major differences in both shape and size indicating that repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19 may be futile.

Due to the rapid dissemination and the unavailability of specific therapy, there is a desperate need for vaccines to combat the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2. An in silico approach based on the available virus genome was applied to identify 19 high immunogenic B-cell epitopes and 499 human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA) restricted T-cell epitopes. Thirty multi-epitope peptide vaccines were designed by iNeo Suite, and manufactured by solid-phase synthesis. Docking analysis showed stable hydrogen bonds of epitopes with their corresponding HLA alleles. When four vaccine peptide candidates from the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were selected to immunize mice, a significantly larger amount of IgG in serum as well as an increase of CD19+ cells in ILNs was observed in peptide-immunized mice compared to the control mice. The ratio of IFN-{gamma}-secreting lymphocytes in CD4+ or CD8+ cells in the peptides-immunized mice were higher than that in the control mice. There were also a larger number of IFN-{gamma}-secreting T cells in spleen in the peptides-immunized mice. This study screened antigenic B-cell and T-cell epitopes in all encoded proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and further designed multi-epitope based peptide vaccine against viral structural proteins. The obtained vaccine peptides successfully elicited specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. Primate experiments and clinical trial are urgently required to validate the efficacy and safety of these vaccine peptides.

10.1101/2020.03.02.973255,Evidence for RNA editing in the transcriptome of 2019 Novel Coronavirus,"The COVID-19 outbreak has become a global health risk and understanding the response of the host to the SARS-CoV-2 virus will help to contrast the disease. Editing by host deaminases is an innate restriction process to counter viruses, and it is not yet known whether it operates against Coronaviruses. Here we analyze RNA sequences from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids derived from infected patients. We identify nucleotide changes that may be signatures of RNA editing: Adenosine-to-Inosine changes from ADAR deaminases and Cytosine-to-Uracil changes from APOBEC ones. A mutational analysis of genomes from different strains of human-hosted Coronaviridae reveals mutational patterns compatible to those observed in the transcriptomic data. Our results thus suggest that both APOBECs and ADARs are involved in Coronavirus genome editing, a process that may shape the fate of both virus and patient.

For the casual ReaderJust to make a few things clear: - RNA editing and DNA editing are PHYSIOLOGICAL processes. Organisms uses them to (a) try to fight viruses, (b) increase heterogeneity inside cells (on many levels), (c) recognise their own RNA.
- our work suggests that: (a) cells use RNA editing in trying to deal with Coronaviruses. We don't know to what extent they succeed (and it would be nice if we could help them). (b) Whatever happens, mutations inserted by RNA editing fuel viral evolution. We don't know whether viruses actively exploit this.

10.1101/2020.03.04.975995,Strong evolutionary convergence of receptor-binding protein spike between COVID-19 and SARS-related coronaviruses,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses (e.g., 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV) are phylogenetically distantly related, but both are capable of infecting human hosts via the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and cause similar clinical and pathological features, suggesting their phenotypic convergence. Yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. Here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. Our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant Darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their RBD protein sequences. In addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, ORF3a, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. Our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV, possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors. Finally, it should be noted that many observed bat SARS-like CoVs that have an evolutionary convergent RBD sequence with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may be pre-adapted to human host receptor ACE2, and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect humans in the future.",2020-03-04,evolutionary biology,COVID-19,COVID-19,coronavirus disease covid and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars related coronaviruses e g ncov and sars cov are phylogenetically distantly related but both are capable of infecting human hosts via the same receptor angiotensin converting enzyme and cause similar clinical and pathological features suggesting their phenotypic convergence yet the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown here we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence our genome level analyses show that the spike protein which is responsible for receptor binding has undergone significant darwinian selection along the branches related to ncov and sars cov further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain rbd of the spike protein between covid and sars related cov clades leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their rbd protein sequences in addition to the spike protein we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein orf a suggesting their possible co evolutionary convergence our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between covid and sars related cov possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors finally it should be noted that many observed bat sars like covs that have an evolutionary convergent rbd sequence with ncov and sars cov may be pre adapted to human host receptor ace and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect humans in the future,coronavirus disease covid severe acute respiratory syndrome sar relate coronaviruse ncov sar cov phylogenetically distantly related capable infect human host via receptor angiotensin convert enzyme cause similar clinical pathological feature suggest phenotypic convergence yet molecular basis underlie phenotypic convergence remain unknown use recently develop molecular phyloecological approach examine molecular basis lead phenotypic convergence genome level analysis show spike protein responsible receptor bind undergone significant darwinian selection along branch relate ncov sar cov examination show unusually high proportion evolutionary convergent amino acid site receptor bind domain rbd spike protein covid sar relate cov clade lead phylogenetic unite rbd protein sequence addition spike protein also find evolutionary convergence partner protein orf suggest possible evolutionary convergence result demonstrate strong adaptive evolutionary convergence covid sar relate cov possibly facilitate adaptation similar identical receptor finally note many observed bat sar like covs evolutionary convergent rbd sequence ncov sars cov may pre adapt human host receptor ace hence would potential new coronavirus source infect human future

While genetically distinct from SARS-CoV, the etiological agent that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, both coronaviruses exhibit receptor binding domain (RBD) conservation and utilize the same host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for virus entry. Therefore, it will be important to test the cross-reactivity of antibodies that have been previously generated against the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV in order to aid research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that an immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV S is highly conserved in multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2. Consistently, four murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against this immunogenic SARS-CoV fragment were able to recognise the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in a mammalian cell line. Importantly, one of them (mAb 1A9) was demonstrated to detect S in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that mAbs targeting the S2 domain of SARS-CoV can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 and this observation is consistent with the high sequence conservation in the S2 subunit.

The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor through which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. By calculating the binding energy score between RBD and ACE2, we highlighted the putative jump in the affinity from a progenitor form of SARS-CoV-2 to the current virus responsible for COVID-19 outbreak. Our result was consistent with previously reported phylogenetic analysis and corroborates the opinion that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than a progressive accumulation of mutations. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to human ACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Moreover, we show from the structural analysis that it is unlikely for the interface residues to be the result of genetic engineering. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD.

Coronavirus has a history of causing epidemics in human and animals. In 2017 an outbreak in piglets by a novel coronavirus was emerged designated as swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) which is originated from the same genus of horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) having a broad species tropism. In addition to human cells, it can also infect cell lines from diverse species. Coronavirus host range is determined by its spike glycoprotein (S). Given the importance of S protein in viral entry to cells and host immune responses, here we report the cryo-EM structure of the SADS-CoV S in the prefusion conformation at a resolution of 3.55 [A]. Our study reveals that SADS-CoV S structure takes an intra-subunit quaternary packing mode where the NTD and CTD from the same subunit pack together by facing each other. The comparison of NTD and CTD with that of the other four genera suggests the evolutionary process of the SADS-CoV S. Moreover, SADS-CoV S has several characteristic structural features, such as more compact architecture of S trimer, and masking of epitopes by glycan shielding, which may facilitate viral immune evasion.

By using genomic, sequence, structural and evolutionary analysis, we show that Alpha- and Beta-CoVs possess several novel families of immunoglobulin (Ig) domain proteins, including ORF8 and ORF7a from SARS-related coronaviruses and two protein groups from certain Alpha-CoVs.

Up to March 3, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 89,000 people in China and other 66 countries across six continents. In this study, we used 10 new sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and combined 136 genomes from GISAID database to investigate the genetic variation and population demography through different analysis approaches (e.g. Network, EBSP, Mismatch, and neutrality tests). The results showed that 80 haplotypes had 183 substitution sites, including 27 parsimony-informative and 156 singletons. Sliding window analyses of genetic diversity suggested a certain mutations abundance in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2, which may be explaining the existing widespread. Phylogenetic analysis showed that, compared with the coronavirus carried by pangolins (Pangolin-CoV), the virus carried by bats (bat-RaTG13-CoV) has a closer relationship with SARS-CoV-2. The network results showed that SARS-CoV-2 had diverse haplotypes around the world by February 11.

10.1101/2020.03.07.981928,Substrate specificity profiling of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease provides basis for anti-COVID-19 drug design,"In December 2019, the first cases of infection with a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, were diagnosed in Wuhan, China. Due to international travel and human-to-human transmission, the virus spread rapidly inside and outside of China. Currently, there is no effective antiviral treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); therefore, research efforts are focused on the rapid development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease constitutes one of the most attractive antiviral drug targets. To address this emerging problem, we have synthesized a combinatorial library of fluorogenic substrates with glutamine in the P1 position. We used it to determine the substrate preferences of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases, using natural and a large panel of unnatural amino acids. On the basis of these findings, we designed and synthesized an inhibitor and two activity-based probes, for one of which we determined the crystal structure of its complex with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Using this approach we visualized SARS-CoV-2 active Mpro within nasopharyngeal epithelial cells of a patient with active COVID-19 infection.

10.1101/2020.03.07.982264,SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to type I interferon pretreatment.,"SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus (CoV) that causes COVID-19, has recently emerged causing an ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia around the world. While distinct from SARS-CoV, both group 2B CoVs share similar genome organization, origins to bat CoVs, and an arsenal of immune antagonists. In this report, we evaluate type-I interferon (IFN-I) sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 relative to the original SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that while SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication to SARS-CoV, the novel CoV is much more sensitive to IFN-I. In Vero and in Calu3 cells, SARS-CoV-2 is substantially attenuated in the context of IFN-I pretreatment, while SARS-CoV is not. In line with these findings, SARS-CoV-2 fails to counteract phosphorylation of STAT1 and expression of ISG proteins, while SARS-CoV is able to suppress both. Comparing SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus in human airway epithelial cultures (HAEC), we observe the absence of IFN-I stimulation by SARS-CoV-2 alone, but detect failure to counteract STAT1 phosphorylation upon IFN-I pretreatment resulting in near ablation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Next, we evaluated IFN-I treatment post infection and found SARS-CoV-2 was sensitive even after establishing infection. Finally, we examined homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonists. The absence of an equivalent open reading frame (ORF) 3b and changes to ORF6 suggest the two key IFN-I antagonists may not maintain equivalent function in SARS-CoV-2. Together, the results identify key differences in susceptibility to IFN-I responses between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that may help inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development.

ImportanceWith the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS-CoV could be leveraged to inform disease progression and eventual treatment options. In addition, these findings could have key implications for animal model development as well as further research into how SARS-CoV-2 modulates the type I IFN response early during infection.

10.1101/2020.03.08.980383,In silico approach to accelerate the development of mass spectrometry-based proteomics methods for detection of viral proteins: Application to COVID-19,"We describe a method for rapid in silico selection of diagnostic peptides from newly described viral pathogens and applied this approach to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. This approach is multi-tiered, beginning with compiling the theoretical protein sequences from genomic derived data. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 we begin with 496 peptides that would be produced by proteolytic digestion of the viral proteins. To eliminate peptides that would cause cross-reactivity and false positives we remove peptides from consideration that have sequence homology or similar chemical characteristics using a progressively larger database of background peptides. Using this pipeline, we can remove 47 peptides from consideration as diagnostic due to the presence of peptides derived from the human proteome. To address the complexity of the human microbiome, we describe a method to create a database of all proteins of relevant abundance in the saliva microbiome. By utilizing a protein-based approach to the microbiome we can more accurately identify peptides that will be problematic in COVID-19 studies which removes 12 peptides from consideration. To identify diagnostic peptides, another 7 peptides are flagged for removal following comparison to the proteome backgrounds of viral and bacterial pathogens of similar clinical presentation. By aligning the protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 field isolates deposited to date we can identify peptides for removal due to their presence in highly variable regions that may lead to false negatives as the pathogen evolves. We provide maps of these regions and highlight 3 peptides that should be avoided as potential diagnostic or vaccine targets. Finally, we leverage publicly deposited proteomics data from human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, as well as a second study with the closely related MERS-CoV to identify the two proteins of highest abundance in human infections. The resulting final list contains the 24 peptides most unique and diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These peptides represent the best targets for the development of antibodies are clinical diagnostics. To demonstrate one application of this we model peptide fragmentation using a deep learning tool to rapidly generate targeted LCMS assays and data processing method for detecting CoVID-19 infected patient samples.

10.1101/2020.03.10.985150,A proposal of an alternative primer for the ARTIC Network's multiplex PCR to improve coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing,"Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread to almost every nation in the world. Soon after the pandemic was recognized by epidemiologists, a group of biologists comprising the ARTIC Network, has devised a multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol and primer set for targeted whole-genome amplification of SARS-CoV-2. The ARTIC primer set amplifies 98 amplicons, which are separated only in two PCRs, across a nearly entire viral genome. The original primer set and protocol showed a fairly small amplification bias when clinical samples with relatively high viral loads were used. However, when samples viral load was low, several amplicons, especially amplicons 18 and 76, exhibited low coverage or complete dropout. We have determined that these dropouts were due to a dimer formation between the forward primer for amplicon 18, 18_LEFT, and the reverse primer for amplicon 76, 76_RIGHT. Replacement of 76_RIGHT with an alternatively designed primer was sufficient to produce a drastic improvement in coverage of both amplicons. Based on this result, we replaced 12 primers in total in the ARTIC primer set that were predicted to be involved in 14 primer interactions. The resulting primer set, version N1 (NIID-1), exhibits improved overall coverage compared to the ARTIC Networks original (V1) and modified (V3) primer set.",2020-03-10,microbiology,COVID-19,COVID-19,since december the coronavirus disease covid caused by a novel coronavirus sars cov has rapidly spread to almost every nation in the world soon after the pandemic was recognized by epidemiologists a group of biologists comprising the artic network has devised a multiplexed polymerase chain reaction pcr protocol and primer set for targeted whole genome amplification of sars cov the artic primer set amplifies amplicons which are separated only in two pcrs across a nearly entire viral genome the original primer set and protocol showed a fairly small amplification bias when clinical samples with relatively high viral loads were used however when samples viral load was low several amplicons especially amplicons and exhibited low coverage or complete dropout we have determined that these dropouts were due to a dimer formation between the forward primer for amplicon left and the reverse primer for amplicon right replacement of right with an alternatively designed primer was sufficient to produce a drastic improvement in coverage of both amplicons based on this result we replaced primers in total in the artic primer set that were predicted to be involved in primer interactions the resulting primer set version n niid exhibits improved overall coverage compared to the artic networks original v and modified v primer set,since december coronavirus disease covid cause novel coronavirus sar cov rapidly spread almost every nation world soon pandemic recognize epidemiologist group biologist comprise artic network devise multiplexed polymerase chain reaction pcr protocol primer set targeted whole genome amplification sar cov artic primer set amplifie amplicon separate two pcr across nearly entire viral genome original primer set protocol show fairly small amplification bias clinical sample relatively high viral load use however sample viral load low several amplicon especially amplicon exhibit low coverage complete dropout determined dropout due dimer formation forward primer amplicon leave reverse primer amplicon right replacement right alternatively design primer sufficient produce drastic improvement coverage amplicon base result replace primer total artic primer set predict involved primer interaction result primer set version niid exhibits improve overall coverage compare artic network original modify primer set
10.1101/2020.03.08.982637,Aerodynamic Characteristics and RNA Concentration of SARS-CoV-2 Aerosol in Wuhan Hospitals during COVID-19 Outbreak,"BackgroundThe ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly and sparked global concern. While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied.

MethodsThirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration.

ResultsThe ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fangcang patient toilet tested positive. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Fangcang MSA had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. PUA had undetectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow.

ConclusionsRoom ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne SARS-CoV-2. The virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",2020-03-10,microbiology,COVID-19,COVID-19,backgroundthe ongoing outbreak of covid has spread rapidly and sparked global concern while the transmission of sars cov through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear the aerosol transmission of sars cov has been little studied methodsthirty five aerosol samples of three different types total suspended particle size segregated and deposition aerosol were collected in patient areas paa and medical staff areas msa of renmin hospital of wuhan university renmin and wuchang fangcang field hospital fangcang and public areas pua in wuhan china during covid outbreak a robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction ddpcr method was employed to quantitate the viral sars cov rna genome and determine aerosol rna concentration resultsthe icu ccu and general patient rooms inside renmin patient hall inside fangcang had undetectable or low airborne sars cov concentration but deposition samples inside icu and air sample in fangcang patient toilet tested positive the airborne sars cov in fangcang msa had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented pua had undetectable airborne sars cov concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow conclusionsroom ventilation open space proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of sars cov gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne sars cov the virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of sars cov,backgroundthe ongoing outbreak covid spread rapidly spark global concern transmission sar cov human respiratory droplet contact infect person clear aerosol transmission sar cov little study methodsthirty five aerosol sample three different type total suspend particle size segregate deposition aerosol collect patient area paa medical staff area msa renmin hospital wuhan university renmin wuchang fangcang field hospital fangcang public area pua wuhan china covid outbreak robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction ddpcr method employ quantitate viral sar cov rna genome determine aerosol rna concentration resultsthe icu ccu general patient room inside renmin patient hall inside fangcang undetectable low airborne sar cov concentration deposition sample inside icu air sample fangcang patient toilet test positive airborne sar cov fangcang msa bimodal distribution high concentration renmin outbreak turn negative patient number reduce rigorous sanitization implement pua undetectable airborne sar cov concentration obviously increase accumulate crowd flow conclusionsroom ventilation open space proper use disinfection toilet effectively limit aerosol transmission sar cov gathering crowd asymptomatic carrier potential source airborne sar cov virus aerosol deposition protective apparel floor surface subsequent resuspension potential transmission pathway effective sanitization critical minimizing aerosol transmission sar cov

There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. In this project, a novel multi-epitope vaccine for COVID-19 virus based on surface glycoprotein was designed through application of bioinformatics methods. At the first, seventeen potent linear B-cell and T-cell binding epitopes from surface glycoprotein were predicted in silico, then the epitopes were joined together via different linkers. The ability of the selected epitopes to induce interferon-gamma was evaluate using IFNepitope web server. One final vaccine was constructed which composed of 398 amino acids and attached to 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 as adjuvant. Physicochemical properties, as well as antigenicity in the proposed vaccines, were checked for defining the vaccine stability and its ability to induce cell-mediated immune responses.

10.1101/2020.03.09.983247,Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection (previously 2019-nCoV) by a highly potent pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting its spike protein that harbors a high capacity to mediate membrane fusion,"The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China has posed a serious threat to global public health. To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be confirmed. Therefore, we herein used a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed plasma membrane fusion capacity superior to that of SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

We compare the interaction between the human ACE2 receptor and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with that of other pathogenic coronaviruses using molecular dynamics simulations. SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and HCoV-NL63 recognize ACE2 as the natural receptor but present a distinct binding interface to ACE2 and a different network of residue-residue contacts. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have comparable binding affinities achieved by balancing energetics and dynamics. The SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 complex contains a higher number of contacts, a larger interface area, and decreased interface residue fluctuations relative to SARS-CoV. These findings expose an exceptional evolutionary exploration exerted by coronaviruses toward host recognition. We postulate that the versatility of cell receptor binding strategies has immediate implications on therapeutic strategies.

The effective concentration of ciclesonide to block SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19) replication (EC90) was 6.3 M. After the eleventh consecutive MERS-CoV passage in the presence of ciclesonide, a resistant mutation was generated, which resulted in an amino acid substitution (A25V) in nonstructural protein (NSP) 15, as identified using reverse genetics. A recombinant virus with the mutation was also resistant to ciclesonide suppression of viral replication.

We developed a data-driven drug repositioning framework, which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large-scale knowledge graph, literature and transcriptome data to discover the potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. The retrospective study using the past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus. Our in silico screening followed by wet-lab validation indicated that a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Our in vitro assays revealed that CVL218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect. In addition, we showed that CVL218 is able to suppress the CpG-induced IL-6 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that it may also have anti-inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of CVL218 in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity, indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, molecular docking simulation suggested that CVL218 may bind to the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2, providing a possible model to explain its antiviral action. We also proposed several possible mechanisms to explain the antiviral activities of PARP1 inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, based on the data present in this study and previous evidences reported in the literature. In summary, the PARP1 inhibitor CVL218 discovered by our data-driven drug repositioning framework can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of COVID-19.",2020-03-12,systems biology,COVID-19,COVID-19,the global spread of sars cov requires an urgent need to find effective therapeutics for the treatment of covid we developed a data driven drug repositioning framework which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large scale knowledge graph literature and transcriptome data to discover the potential drug candidates against sars cov the retrospective study using the past sars cov and mers cov data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus our in silico screening followed by wet lab validation indicated that a poly adp ribose polymerase parp inhibitor cvl currently in phase i clinical trial may be repurposed to treat covid our in vitro assays revealed that cvl can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against sars cov replication without obvious cytopathic effect in addition we showed that cvl is able to suppress the cpg induced il production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells suggesting that it may also have anti inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by sars cov infection further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of cvl in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by sars cov infection moreover molecular docking simulation suggested that cvl may bind to the n terminal domain of nucleocapsid n protein of sars cov providing a possible model to explain its antiviral action we also proposed several possible mechanisms to explain the antiviral activities of parp inhibitors against sars cov based on the data present in this study and previous evidences reported in the literature in summary the parp inhibitor cvl discovered by our data driven drug repositioning framework can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of covid,global spread sar cov require urgent need find effective therapeutic treatment covid develop datum drive drug reposition framework apply machine learn statistical analysis approach systematically integrate mine large scale knowledge graph literature transcriptome data discover potential drug candidate sar cov retrospective study use past sar cov mer cov datum demonstrate machine learn base method successfully predict effective drug candidate specific coronavirus silico screening follow wet lab validation indicate poly adp ribose polymerase parp inhibitor cvl currently phase clinical trial may repurpose treat covid vitro assay reveal cvl exhibit effective inhibitory activity sar cov replication without obvious cytopathic effect addition show cvl able suppress cpg induce production peripheral blood mononuclear cell suggest may also anti inflammatory effect highly relevant prevention immunopathology induce sar cov infection pharmacokinetic toxicokinetic evaluation rat monkey show high concentration cvl lung observe apparent sign toxicity indicate appeal potential drug treatment pneumonia cause sar cov infection moreover molecular docking simulation suggest cvl may bind terminal domain nucleocapsid protein sar cov provide possible model explain antiviral action also propose several possible mechanism explain antiviral activity parp inhibitor sar cov base datum present study previous evidence report literature summary parp inhibitor cvl discover datum drive drug reposition framework serve potential therapeutic agent treatment covid

10.1101/2020.03.11.983056,"Novel and potent inhibitors targeting DHODH, a rate-limiting enzyme in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, are broad-spectrum antiviral against RNA viruses including newly emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2","Emerging and re-emerging RNA viruses occasionally cause epidemics and pandemics worldwide, such as the on-going outbreak of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Existing direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses because of virus-specificity, and the development of new DAA drugs from the beginning is not timely for outbreaks. Thus, host-targeting antiviral (HTA) drugs have many advantages to fight against a broad spectrum of viruses, by blocking the viral replication and overcoming the potential viral mutagenesis simultaneously. Herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of DHODH, S312 and S416, with favorable drug-like and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H9N2), Zika virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against the recent novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Our results are the first to validate that DHODH is an attractive host target through high antiviral efficacy in vivo and low virus replication in DHODH knocking-out cells. We also proposed the drug combination of DAA and HTA was a promising strategy for anti-virus treatment and proved that S312 showed more advantageous than Oseltamivir to treat advanced influenza diseases in severely infected animals. Notably, S416 is reported to be the most potent inhibitor with an EC50 of 17nM and SI value >5882 in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells so far.

Among them, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most commonly used because of its high sensitivity, typically claiming detection of about 5 copies of viruses. However, it has been reported that only 47-59% of the positive cases were identified by some RT-PCR methods, probably due to low viral load, timing of sampling, degradation of virus RNA in the sampling process, or possible mutations spanning the primer binding sites. Therefore, alternative and highly sensitive methods are imperative. With the goal of improving sensitivity and accommodating various application settings, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based method comprised of 343 pairs of specific primers, and demonstrated its efficiency to detect SARS-CoV-2 at low copy numbers. The assay produced clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allowed for direct identification of positives by electrophoresis. We further amplified the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome from 8 to half a million viral copies purified from 13 COVID-19 positive specimens, and detected mutations through next generation sequencing.

The monkeys rechallenged with the identical SARS-CoV-2 strain have failed to produce detectable viral dissemination, clinical manifestations and histopathological changes. A notably enhanced neutralizing antibody response might contribute the protection of rhesus macaques from the reinfection by SARS-CoV-2.

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 was reported recently, but its transcriptomic architecture is unknown. Utilizing two complementary sequencing techniques, we here present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. DNA nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical. In addition to the genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs common in all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 produces a large number of transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral transcripts, with the most frequent motif being AAGAA. Modified RNAs have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the internal modification and the 3' tail. Functional investigation of the unknown ORFs and RNA modifications discovered in this study will open new directions to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.

Here, we reported a research finding that SARS-CoV-2 invaded host cells via a novel route of CD147-spike protein (SP). SP bound to CD147, a receptor on the host cells, thereby mediating the viral invasion. Our further research confirmed this finding. First, in vitro antiviral tests indicated Meplazumab, an anti-CD147 humanized antibody, significantly inhibited the viruses from invading host cells, with an EC50 of 24.86 g/mL and IC50 of 15.16 g/mL. Second, we validated the interaction between CD147 and SP, with an affinity constant of 1.85x10-7M. Co-Immunoprecipitation and ELISA also confirmed the binding of the two proteins. Finally, the localization of CD147 and SP was observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells by immuno-electron microscope.

10.1101/2020.03.13.990598,Dark proteome of Newly Emerged SARS-CoV-2 in Comparison with Human and Bat Coronaviruses,"Recently emerged coronavirus designated as SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or Wuhan coronavirus) is a causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is rapidly spreading throughout the world now. More than 9,00,000 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and more than 47,000 COVID-19-associated mortalities have been reported worldwide till the writing of this article, and these numbers are increasing every passing hour. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the SARS-CoV-2 spread as a global public health emergency and admitted that the COVID-19 is a pandemic now. The multiple sequence alignment data correlated with the already published reports on the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and indicated that this virus is closely related to the bat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-like coronavirus (bat SARS-like CoV) and the well-studied Human SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV). The disordered regions in viral proteins are associated with the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Therefore, in this study, we have exploited a set of complementary computational approaches to examine the dark proteomes of SARS-CoV-2, bat SARS-like, and human SARS CoVs by analysing the prevalence of intrinsic disorder in their proteins. According to our findings, SARS-CoV-2 proteome contains very significant levels of structural order. In fact, except for Nucleocapsid, Nsp8, and ORF6, the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are mostly ordered proteins containing less intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs). However, IDPRs found in SARS-CoV-2 proteins are functionally important. For example, cleavage sites in its replicase 1ab polyprotein are found to be highly disordered, and almost all SARS-CoV-2 proteins were shown to contain molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which are intrinsic disorder-based protein-protein interaction sites that are commonly utilized by proteins for interaction with specific partners. The results of our extensive investigation of the dark side of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome will have important implications for the structural and non-structural biology of SARS or SARS-like coronaviruses.

SignificanceThe infection caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes severe respiratory disease with pneumonia-like symptoms in humans is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. No in-depth information on structures and functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins is currently available in the public domain, and no effective anti-viral drugs and/or vaccines are designed for the treatment of this infection.

10.1101/2020.03.13.991083,Structural and functional conservation of the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift signal of SARS-CoV-2,"17 years after the SARS-CoV epidemic, the world is facing the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take over a year to develop a vaccine, the best short-term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called -1 PRF to control the relative expression of their proteins. Prior analyses of SARS-CoV revealed that it employs a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of -1 PRF, and that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element. Altering -1 PRF activity negatively impacts virus replication, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted. Here we present a comparative analysis of the original SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural and functional analyses revealed that both elements promote similar rates of -1 PRF and that silent coding mutations in the slippery sites and in all three stems of the pseudoknot strongly ablated -1 PRF activity. The upstream attenuator hairpin activity has also been functionally retained. Small-angle x-ray scattering indicated that the pseudoknots in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 had the same conformation. Finally, a small molecule previously shown to bind the SARS-CoV pseudoknot and inhibit -1 PRF was similarly effective against -1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that such frameshift inhibitors may provide promising lead compounds to counter the current pandemic.",2020-03-15,genetics,COVID-19,COVID-19,years after the sars cov epidemic the world is facing the covid pandemic covid is caused by a coronavirus named sars cov given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take over a year to develop a vaccine the best short term strategy may lie in identifying virus specific targets for small molecule interventions all coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called prf to control the relative expression of their proteins prior analyses of sars cov revealed that it employs a structurally unique three stemmed mrna pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of prf and that it also harbors a prf attenuation element altering prf activity negatively impacts virus replication suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted here we present a comparative analysis of the original sars cov and sars cov frameshift signals structural and functional analyses revealed that both elements promote similar rates of prf and that silent coding mutations in the slippery sites and in all three stems of the pseudoknot strongly ablated prf activity the upstream attenuator hairpin activity has also been functionally retained small angle x ray scattering indicated that the pseudoknots in sars cov and sars cov had the same conformation finally a small molecule previously shown to bind the sars cov pseudoknot and inhibit prf was similarly effective against prf in sars cov suggesting that such frameshift inhibitors may provide promising lead compounds to counter the current pandemic,year sar cov epidemic world face covid pandemic covid cause coronavirus name sar cov give optimistic projection estimate take year develop vaccine good short term strategy may lie identify virus specific target small molecule intervention coronaviruse utilize molecular mechanism call prf control relative expression protein prior analyse sar cov reveal employ structurally unique three stem mrna pseudoknot stimulate high rate prf also harbor prf attenuation element alter prf activity negatively impact virus replication suggest molecular mechanism may therapeutically target present comparative analysis original sar cov sar cov frameshift signal structural functional analysis reveal element promote similar rate prf silent coding mutation slippery site three stem pseudoknot strongly ablate prf activity upstream attenuator hairpin activity also functionally retain small angle ray scattering indicate pseudoknot sar cov sar cov conformation finally small molecule previously show bind sar cov pseudoknot inhibit prf similarly effective prf sar cov suggest frameshift inhibitor may provide promising lead compound counter current pandemic
10.1101/2020.03.15.991844,RBD mutations from circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains enhance the structure stability and infectivity of the spike protein,"The current global pandemic of COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. To investigate whether naturally occurring mutations in the RBD during the early transmission phase have altered the receptor binding affinity and infectivity, firstly we analyzed in silico the binding dynamics between mutated SARS-CoV-2 RBDs and the human ACE2 receptor. Among 32,123 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates (January through March, 2020), 302 non-synonymous RBD mutants were identified and clustered into 96 mutant types. The six dominant mutations were analyzed applying molecular dynamics simulations. The mutant type V367F continuously circulating worldwide displayed higher binding affinity to human ACE2 due to the enhanced structural stabilization of the RBD beta-sheet scaffold. The increased infectivity of V367 mutants was further validated by performing receptor-ligand binding ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, and pseudotyped virus assays. Genome phylogenetic analysis of V367F mutants showed that during the early transmission phase, most V367F mutants clustered more closely with the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain than the dual-mutation variants (V367F + D614G) which emerged later and formed a distinct sub-cluster. The analysis of critical RBD mutations provides further insights into the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 under negative selection pressure and supports the continuing surveillance of spike mutations to aid in the development of new COVID-19 drugs and vaccines.

ImportanceA novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused the pandemic of COVID-19. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 was associated with zoonotic infections. The spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is identified as the critical determinant of viral tropism and infectivity. Thus, whether the mutations in the RBD of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates have altered the receptor binding affinity and caused them more infectious, should be paid more attentions to. Given that SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, the significance of our research is in identifying and validating the RBD mutant types emerging during the early transmission phase that have increased human ACE2 receptor binding affinity and infectivity. The RBD mutation analysis provides insights into SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

The three proteins confer excellent antigenicity with six convalescent COVID-19 patient sera.

10.1101/2020.03.15.992883,A Cryptic Site of Vulnerability on the Receptor Binding Domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein,"SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus that has caused a pandemic of severe respiratory disease--COVID-19-- within several months of its initial identification. Comparable to the first SARS-CoV, this novel coronaviruss surface Spike (S) glycoprotein mediates cell entry via the human ACE-2 receptor, and, thus, is the principal target for the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics. Molecular information on the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein remains limited. Here we report the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S receptor-binding-domain (RBD) at a the highest resolution to date, of 1.95 [A]. We identified a set of SARS-reactive monoclonal antibodies with cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and other betacoronavirus S glycoproteins. One of these antibodies, CR3022, was previously shown to synergize with antibodies that target the ACE-2 binding site on the SARS-CoV RBD and reduce viral escape capacity. We determined the structure of CR3022, in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and defined a broadly reactive epitope that is highly conserved across betacoronaviruses. This epitope is inaccessible in the ""closed"" prefusion S structure, but is accessible in ""open"" conformations. This first-ever resolution of a human antibody in complex with SARS-CoV-2 and the broad reactivity of this set of antibodies to a conserved betacoronavirus epitope will allow antigenic assessment of vaccine candidates, and provide a framework for accelerated vaccine, immunotherapeutic and diagnostic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses.

10.1101/2020.03.15.993097,Cross-reactive antibody response between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections,"The World Health Organization has recently declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, as pandemic. There is currently a lack of knowledge in the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One major immunological question is concerning the antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by using plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, and plasma obtained from infected or immunized mice.

10.1101/2020.03.16.993816,Evidence of the Recombinant Origin and Ongoing Mutations in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2),"The recent global outbreak of viral pneumonia designated as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has threatened global public health and urged to investigate its source. Whole genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed ~96% genomic similarity with bat CoV (RaTG13) and clustered together in phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, RaTGl3 also showed 97.43% spike protein similarity with SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that RaTGl3 is the closest strain. However, RBD and key amino acid residues supposed to be crucial for human-to-human and cross-species transmission are homologues between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin CoVs. These results from our analysis suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant virus of bat and pangolin CoVs. Moreover, this study also reports mutations in coding regions of 125 SARS-CoV-2 genomes signifying its aptitude for evolution.

10.1101/2020.03.16.990317,Recapitulation of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Cholangiocyte Damage with Human Liver Organoids,"The newly emerged pandemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has posed a significant public health threat worldwide. However, the mode of virus transmission and tissue tropism is not well established yet. Recent findings of substantial liver damage in patients and ACE2+ cholangiocytes in healthy liver tissues prompted us to hypothesize that human liver ductal organoids could serve as a model to determine the susceptibility and mechanisms underlining the liver damage upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that long-term liver ductal organoid culture preserved the human specific ACE2+ population of cholangiocytes. Moreover, human liver ductal organoids were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and support robust replication. Notably, virus infection impaired the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes through dysregulation of genes involved in tight junction formation and bile acid transportation, which could explain the bile acid accumulation and consequent liver damage in patients. These results indicate that control of liver damage caused directly by viral infection should be valued in treating COVID-19 patients. Our findings also provide an application of human organoids in investigating the tropism and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, which would facilitate novel drug discovery.",2020-03-17,cell biology,COVID-19,COVID-19,the newly emerged pandemic coronavirus sars cov has posed a significant public health threat worldwide however the mode of virus transmission and tissue tropism is not well established yet recent findings of substantial liver damage in patients and ace cholangiocytes in healthy liver tissues prompted us to hypothesize that human liver ductal organoids could serve as a model to determine the susceptibility and mechanisms underlining the liver damage upon sars cov infection by single cell rna sequencing we found that long term liver ductal organoid culture preserved the human specific ace population of cholangiocytes moreover human liver ductal organoids were permissive to sars cov infection and support robust replication notably virus infection impaired the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes through dysregulation of genes involved in tight junction formation and bile acid transportation which could explain the bile acid accumulation and consequent liver damage in patients these results indicate that control of liver damage caused directly by viral infection should be valued in treating covid patients our findings also provide an application of human organoids in investigating the tropism and pathogenesis of sars cov which would facilitate novel drug discovery,newly emerge pandemic coronavirus sar cov pose significant public health threat worldwide however mode virus transmission tissue tropism well establish yet recent finding substantial liver damage patient ace cholangiocyte healthy liver tissue prompt hypothesize human liver ductal organoid could serve model determine susceptibility mechanism underline liver damage upon sar cov infection single cell rna sequence find long term liver ductal organoid culture preserve human specific ace population cholangiocyte moreover human liver ductal organoid permissive sar cov infection support robust replication notably virus infection impair barrier bile acid transport function cholangiocyte dysregulation gene involve tight junction formation bile acid transportation could explain bile acid accumulation consequent liver damage patient result indicate control liver damage cause directly viral infection value treat covid patient finding also provide application human organoid investigate tropism pathogenesis sar cov would facilitate novel drug discovery

To compare its pathogenesis with that of previously emerging coronaviruses, we inoculated cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV and compared with historical SARS-CoV infections. In SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques, virus was excreted from nose and throat in absence of clinical signs, and detected in type I and II pneumocytes in foci of diffuse alveolar damage and mucous glands of the nasal cavity. In SARS-CoV-infection, lung lesions were typically more severe, while they were milder in MERS-CoV infection, where virus was detected mainly in type II pneumocytes. These data show that SARS-CoV-2 can cause a COVID-19-like disease, and suggest that the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is intermediate between that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

10.1101/2020.03.19.999318,The first-in-class peptide binder to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is an emerging global health crisis. With over 7 million confirmed cases to date, this pandemic continues to expand, spurring research to discover vaccines and therapies. SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus responsible for this disease. It initiates entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein (S). Disrupting the SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding to ACE2 with designer drugs has the potential to inhibit the virus from entering human cells, presenting a new modality for therapeutic intervention. Peptide-based binders are an attractive solution to inhibit the RBD-ACE2 interaction by adequately covering the extended protein contact interface. Using molecular dynamics simulations based on the recently solved cryo-EM structure of ACE2 in complex with SARS-CoV-2-RBD, we observed that the ACE2 peptidase domain (PD) 1 helix is important for binding SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Using automated fast-flow peptide synthesis, we chemically synthesized a 23-mer peptide fragment of the ACE2 PD 1 helix (SBP1) composed entirely of proteinogenic amino acids. Chemical synthesis of SBP1 was complete in 1.5 hours, and after work up and isolation >20 milligrams of pure material was obtained. Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) revealed that SBP1 associates with micromolar affinity to insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-RBD protein obtained from Sino Biological. Association of SBP1 was not observed to an appreciable extent to HEK cell-expressed SARS-CoV-2-RBD proteins and insect-derived variants acquired from other vendors. Moreover, competitive BLI assays showed SBP1 does not outcompete ACE2 binding to Sino Biological insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-RBD.

Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously demonstrated that three nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Here, using polymerase extension experiments, we have demonstrated that the active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir (a key component of the FDA approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA), is incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and blocks further incorporation. Using the same molecular insight, we selected the active triphosphate forms of three other anti-viral agents, Alovudine, AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) and Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF, an FDA approved drug for HIV and hepatitis B) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. We demonstrated the ability of these three viral polymerase inhibitors, 3-fluoro-3-deoxythymidine triphosphate, 3-azido-3-deoxythymidine triphosphate and Tenofovir diphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine, AZT and TAF, respectively) to be incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, where they also terminate further polymerase extension.

10.1101/2020.02.10.942839,Demonstration of resistance to satyrization behavior in Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) from La Reunion island,"Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are competent vectors of arboviruses such as dengue and chikungunya viruses which co-exist in some areas including La Reunion island. A kind of reproductive interference called satyrization has been described in sympatric species where a dominant species tends to control the spread of the other species. Here, we investigated satyrization in laboratory experiments to provide insights on the potential impact on Ae. aegypti of a control campaign including a sterile insect technique component against Ae. albopictus. Different mating crosses were used to test sympatric, conspecific-interspecific and allopatric effects of irradiated and non-irradiated male Ae. albopictus on female Ae. aegypti, including in a situation of skewed male ratio. Our results suggest that there was only a low level of satyrization between sympatric populations of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus colonised from La Reunion island. A male Ae. albopictus to female Ae. aegypti ratio of 3:1 did not increase the level of satyrization. Female Ae. aegypti previously mated to male Ae. albopictus were not prevented from being inseminated by conspecific male Ae. aegypti.

10.1101/784678,ISG15/USP18/STAT2 is a molecular hub regulating autocrine IFN I-mediated control of Dengue and Zika virus replication,"The establishment of a virus infection is the result of the pathogens ability to replicate in a hostile environment generated by the hosts immune system. Here, we found that ISG15 restricts Dengue and Zika viruses replication through the stabilisation of its binding partner USP18. ISG15 expression was necessary to control DV replication driven by both autocrine and paracrine type one interferon (IFN-I) signalling. Moreover, USP18 competes with NS5-mediated STAT2 degradation, a major mechanism for establishment of flavivirus infection. Strikingly, reconstitution of USP18 in ISG15-deficient cells was sufficient to restore the STAT2s stability and restrict virus growth, suggesting that the IFNAR-mediated ISG15 activity is also antiviral. Our results add a novel layer of complexity in the virus/host interaction interface and suggest that NS5 has a narrow window of opportunity to degrade STAT2, therefore suppressing hosts IFN-I mediated response and promoting virus replication.

IMPORTANCEDisease is an emergent property that results from a microorganisms ability to replicate in a given host and the latters immune response. Here we describe how the immunoregulatory function of ISG15 (an interferon stimulated gene) affects Dengue and Zika virus replication by occupying a niche used by the virus non-structural protein 5 (NS5) to evade hosts immunity. In the absence of ISG15, NS5 efficiently degrades a main signalling hub of innate immunity (STAT2), leading to cell immune suppression and consequently virus growth. This sheds light into how flaviviruses intimately interact with the host immune system and could lead to a host-based therapy target.",2023-07-15,immunology,Dengue,Dengue,the establishment of a virus infection is the result of the pathogens ability to replicate in a hostile environment generated by the hosts immune system here we found that isg restricts dengue and zika viruses replication through the stabilisation of its binding partner usp isg expression was necessary to control dv replication driven by both autocrine and paracrine type one interferon ifn i signalling moreover usp competes with ns mediated stat degradation a major mechanism for establishment of flavivirus infection strikingly reconstitution of usp in isg deficient cells was sufficient to restore the stat s stability and restrict virus growth suggesting that the ifnar mediated isg activity is also antiviral our results add a novel layer of complexity in the virus host interaction interface and suggest that ns has a narrow window of opportunity to degrade stat therefore suppressing hosts ifn i mediated response and promoting virus replication importancedisease is an emergent property that results from a microorganisms ability to replicate in a given host and the latters immune response here we describe how the immunoregulatory function of isg an interferon stimulated gene affects dengue and zika virus replication by occupying a niche used by the virus non structural protein ns to evade hosts immunity in the absence of isg ns efficiently degrades a main signalling hub of innate immunity stat leading to cell immune suppression and consequently virus growth this sheds light into how flaviviruses intimately interact with the host immune system and could lead to a host based therapy target,establishment virus infection result pathogen ability replicate hostile environment generate host immune system find isg restrict dengue zika viruse replication stabilisation bind partner usp isg expression necessary control replication drive autocrine paracrine type one interferon ifn signal moreover usp compete mediate stat degradation major mechanism establishment flavivirus infection strikingly reconstitution usp isg deficient cell sufficient restore stat stability restrict virus growth suggest ifnar mediate isg activity also antiviral result add novel layer complexity virus host interaction interface suggest narrow window opportunity degrade stat therefore suppress host ifn mediate response promote virus replication importancedisease emergent property result microorganism ability replicate give host latter immune response describe immunoregulatory function isg interferon stimulated gene affect dengue zika virus replication occupy niche use virus non structural protein evade host immunity absence isg efficiently degrade main signal hub innate immunity stat lead cell immune suppression consequently virus growth shed light flavivirus intimately interact host immune system could lead host base therapy target

10.1101/2020.02.20.957423,Novel phenotype of Wolbachia strain wPip in Aedes aegypti challenges assumptions on mechanisms of Wolbachia-mediated dengue virusinhibition .,"The bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia is a biocontrol tool that inhibits the ability of the Aedes aegypti mosquito to transmit positive-sense RNA viruses such as dengue and Zika. Growing evidence indicates that when Wolbachia strains wMel or wAlbB are introduced into local mosquito populations, human dengue incidence is reduced. Despite the success of this novel intervention, we still do not fully understand how Wolbachia protects mosquitoes from viral infection. Here, we demonstrate that the Wolbachia strain wPip does not inhibit virus infection in Ae. aegypti. We have leveraged this novel finding, and a panel of Ae. aegypti lines carrying virus-inhibitory (wMel and wAlbB) and non-inhibitory (wPip) strains in a common genetic background, to rigorously test a number of hypotheses about the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated virus inhibition. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous suggestions, there is no association between a strains ability to inhibit dengue infection in the mosquito and either its typical density in the midgut or salivary glands, or the degree to which it elevates innate immune response pathways in the mosquito. These findings, and the experimental platform provided by this panel of genetically comparable mosquito lines, clear the way for future investigations to define how Wolbachia prevents Ae. aegypti from transmitting viruses.

Author summaryDengue virus, transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is one of the fastest-growing infectious diseases, causing an estimated 390 million human infections per year worldwide. Vaccines have limited efficacy and there are no approved therapeutics. This has driven the rise of novel vector control programs, in particular those that use the bacterium, Wolbachia, which prevents transmission of dengue and other human pathogenic viruses when stably introduced into Ae. aegypti populations. Although this is proving to be a highly effective method, the details of how this biocontrol tool works are not well understood. Here we characterise a new Wolbachia strain, wPip, and find that Ae. aegypti carrying wPip are still able to transmit dengue similar to mosquitoes that do not carry Wolbachia. This finding has allowed us to begin a rigorous program of comparative studies to determine which features of a Wolbachia strain determine whether it is antiviral. Understanding these mechanisms will enable us to predict the risk of viral resistance arising against Wolbachia and facilitate preparation of second-generation field release lines.",2020-02-20,microbiology,Dengue,Dengue,the bacterial endosymbiont wolbachia is a biocontrol tool that inhibits the ability of the aedes aegypti mosquito to transmit positive sense rna viruses such as dengue and zika growing evidence indicates that when wolbachia strains wmel or walbb are introduced into local mosquito populations human dengue incidence is reduced despite the success of this novel intervention we still do not fully understand how wolbachia protects mosquitoes from viral infection here we demonstrate that the wolbachia strain wpip does not inhibit virus infection in ae aegypti we have leveraged this novel finding and a panel of ae aegypti lines carrying virus inhibitory wmel and walbb and non inhibitory wpip strains in a common genetic background to rigorously test a number of hypotheses about the mechanism of wolbachia mediated virus inhibition we demonstrate that contrary to previous suggestions there is no association between a strains ability to inhibit dengue infection in the mosquito and either its typical density in the midgut or salivary glands or the degree to which it elevates innate immune response pathways in the mosquito these findings and the experimental platform provided by this panel of genetically comparable mosquito lines clear the way for future investigations to define how wolbachia prevents ae aegypti from transmitting viruses author summarydengue virus transmitted by the aedes aegypti mosquito is one of the fastest growing infectious diseases causing an estimated million human infections per year worldwide vaccines have limited efficacy and there are no approved therapeutics this has driven the rise of novel vector control programs in particular those that use the bacterium wolbachia which prevents transmission of dengue and other human pathogenic viruses when stably introduced into ae aegypti populations although this is proving to be a highly effective method the details of how this biocontrol tool works are not well understood here we characterise a new wolbachia strain wpip and find that ae aegypti carrying wpip are still able to transmit dengue similar to mosquitoes that do not carry wolbachia this finding has allowed us to begin a rigorous program of comparative studies to determine which features of a wolbachia strain determine whether it is antiviral understanding these mechanisms will enable us to predict the risk of viral resistance arising against wolbachia and facilitate preparation of second generation field release lines,bacterial endosymbiont wolbachia biocontrol tool inhibit ability aede aegypti mosquito transmit positive sense rna viruse dengue zika grow evidence indicate wolbachia strain wmel walbb introduce local mosquito population human dengue incidence reduce despite success novel intervention still fully understand wolbachia protect mosquitoe viral infection demonstrate wolbachia strain wpip inhibit virus infection aegypti leverage novel finding panel aegypti line carry virus inhibitory wmel walbb non inhibitory wpip strain common genetic background rigorously test number hypothesis mechanism wolbachia mediate virus inhibition demonstrate contrary previous suggestion association strain ability inhibit dengue infection mosquito either typical density midgut salivary gland degree elevate innate immune response pathway mosquito finding experimental platform provide panel genetically comparable mosquito line clear way future investigation define wolbachia prevent aegypti transmit virus author summarydengue virus transmit aede aegypti mosquito one fast grow infectious disease cause estimate million human infection per year worldwide vaccine limited efficacy approve therapeutic drive rise novel vector control program particular use bacterium wolbachia prevent transmission dengue human pathogenic virus stably introduce aegypti population although prove highly effective method detail biocontrol tool work well understand characterise new wolbachia strain wpip find aegypti carrying wpip still able transmit dengue similar mosquito carry wolbachia finding allow begin rigorous program comparative study determine feature wolbachia strain determine whether antiviral understanding mechanism enable predict risk viral resistance arise wolbachia facilitate preparation second generation field release line
10.1101/2020.11.11.378646,Dengue virus protease activity modulated by dynamics of protease cofactor,"The viral protease domain (NS3pro) of dengue virus is essential for virus replication and its cofactor NS2B is indispensable for the proteolytic function. Although several NS3pro-NS2B complex structures have been obtained, the dynamic property of the complex remains poorly understood. Using NMR relaxation techniques, here we found that NS3pro-NS2B exists in both closed and open conformations which are in dynamic equilibrium on a sub-millisecond timescale in aqueous solution. Our structural information indicates that the C-terminal region of NS2B is disordered in the open conformation but folded in the closed conformation. Using mutagenesis, we showed that the closed-open conformational equilibrium can be shifted by changing NS2B stability. Moreover, we revealed that the proteolytic activity of NS3pro-NS2B correlates well with the population of the closed conformation. Our results suggest that the closed-open conformational equilibrium can be used by both nature and man to control the replication of dengue virus.

Statement of SignificanceThe dengue virus protease is an attractive target for drug development against dengue fever as it is essential for virus replication. However, its structure-based drug development has been unsuccessful due to the shallow substrate-binding pocket. The study presented here demonstrates for the first time that the protease activity can be reduced dramatically by shifting the closed-open conformational equilibrium of the protease in complex with its cofactor from the majority of a closed conformation to the majority of an open conformation. Moreover, our work clarifies the structure of the open conformation which has been elusive for a long time.

10.1101/2020.01.20.912097,The effects of seasonal climate variability on dengueannual incidence in Hong Kong: A modellingstudy,"In recent years, dengue has been rapidly spreading and growing in the tropics and subtropics. Located in southern China, Hong Kongs subtropical monsoon climate may favour dengue vector populations and increase the chance of disease transmissions during the rainy summer season. An increase in local dengue incidence has been observed in Hong Kong ever since the first case in 2002, with an outbreak reaching historically high case numbers in 2018. However, the effects of seasonal climate variability on recent outbreaks are unknown. As the local cases were found to be spatially clustered, we developed a Poisson generalized linear mixed model using pre-summer monthly total rainfall and mean temperature to predict annual dengue incidence (the majority of local cases occur during or after the summer months), over the period 2002-2018 in three pre-defined areas of Hong Kong. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, 5 out of 6 observations of area-specific outbreaks during the major outbreak years 2002 and 2018 were able to be predicted. 42 out of a total of 51 observations (82.4%) were within the 95% confidence interval of the annual incidence predicted by our model. Our study found that the rainfall before and during the East Asian monsoon (pre-summer) rainy season is negatively correlated with the annual incidence in Hong Kong while the temperature is positively correlated. Hence, as mosquito control measures in Hong Kong are intensified mainly when heavy rainfalls occur during or close to summer, our study suggests that a lower-than-average intensity of pre-summer rainfall should also be taken into account as an indicator of increased dengue risk.",2020-01-21,ecology,Dengue,Dengue,in recent years dengue has been rapidly spreading and growing in the tropics and subtropics located in southern china hong kongs subtropical monsoon climate may favour dengue vector populations and increase the chance of disease transmissions during the rainy summer season an increase in local dengue incidence has been observed in hong kong ever since the first case in with an outbreak reaching historically high case numbers in however the effects of seasonal climate variability on recent outbreaks are unknown as the local cases were found to be spatially clustered we developed a poisson generalized linear mixed model using pre summer monthly total rainfall and mean temperature to predict annual dengue incidence the majority of local cases occur during or after the summer months over the period in three pre defined areas of hong kong using leave one out cross validation out of observations of area specific outbreaks during the major outbreak years and were able to be predicted out of a total of observations were within the confidence interval of the annual incidence predicted by our model our study found that the rainfall before and during the east asian monsoon pre summer rainy season is negatively correlated with the annual incidence in hong kong while the temperature is positively correlated hence as mosquito control measures in hong kong are intensified mainly when heavy rainfalls occur during or close to summer our study suggests that a lower than average intensity of pre summer rainfall should also be taken into account as an indicator of increased dengue risk,recent year dengue rapidly spread grow tropic subtropic locate southern china hong kongs subtropical monsoon climate may favour dengue vector population increase chance disease transmission rainy summer season increase local dengue incidence observe hong kong ever since first case outbreak reach historically high case number however effect seasonal climate variability recent outbreak unknown local case find spatially cluster develop poisson generalize linear mixed model use pre summer monthly total rainfall mean temperature predict annual dengue incidence majority local case occur summer month period three pre define area hong kong use leave one cross validation observation area specific outbreak major outbreak year able predict total observation within confidence interval annual incidence predict model study find rainfall east asian monsoon pre summer rainy season negatively correlate annual incidence hong kong temperature positively correlate hence mosquito control measure hong kong intensify mainly heavy rainfall occur close summer study suggest low average intensity pre summer rainfall also take account indicator increase dengue risk
10.1101/2020.07.31.230425,Temperature alters gene expression in mosquitoes during arbovirus infection,"Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya constitute a significant proportion of the global disease burden. The principal vector of these pathogens is the mosquito Aedes (Ae.) aegypti, and its ability to transmit virus to a human host is influenced by environmental factors such as temperature. However, exactly how ambient temperature influences virus replication within mosquitoes remains poorly elucidated, particularly at the molecular level. Here, we use chikungunya virus (CHIKV) as a model to understand how the host mosquito transcriptome responds to arbovirus infection under different ambient temperatures. We exposed CHIKV-infected mosquitoes to 18 {degrees}C, 28 {degrees}C and 32 {degrees}C, and found higher temperature correlated with higher virus replication levels, particularly at early time points post-infection. Lower ambient temperatures resulted in reduced virus replication levels. Using RNAseq, we found that temperature significantly altered gene expression levels in mosquitoes, particularly components of the immune response. The highest number of significantly differentially expressed genes in response to CHIKV was observed at 28 {degrees}C, with a markedly more muted effect observed at either lower (18 {degrees}C) or higher (32 {degrees}C) temperatures. At the higher temperature, the expression of many classical immune genes, including Dicer-2 in the RNAi pathway, was not substantially altered in response to CHIKV. Upregulation of Toll, IMD and JAK-STAT pathways was only observed at 28 {degrees}C. Time post infection also led to substantially different gene expression profiles, and this effect varied depending upon the which temperature mosquitoes were exposed to. Taken together, our data indicate temperature significantly modulates mosquito gene expression in response to infection, potentially leading to impairment of immune defences at higher ambient temperatures.",2020-07-31,microbiology,Dengue,Dengue,arthropod borne viruses arboviruses such as dengue zika and chikungunya constitute a significant proportion of the global disease burden the principal vector of these pathogens is the mosquito aedes ae aegypti and its ability to transmit virus to a human host is influenced by environmental factors such as temperature however exactly how ambient temperature influences virus replication within mosquitoes remains poorly elucidated particularly at the molecular level here we use chikungunya virus chikv as a model to understand how the host mosquito transcriptome responds to arbovirus infection under different ambient temperatures we exposed chikv infected mosquitoes to degrees c degrees c and degrees c and found higher temperature correlated with higher virus replication levels particularly at early time points post infection lower ambient temperatures resulted in reduced virus replication levels using rnaseq we found that temperature significantly altered gene expression levels in mosquitoes particularly components of the immune response the highest number of significantly differentially expressed genes in response to chikv was observed at degrees c with a markedly more muted effect observed at either lower degrees c or higher degrees c temperatures at the higher temperature the expression of many classical immune genes including dicer in the rnai pathway was not substantially altered in response to chikv upregulation of toll imd and jak stat pathways was only observed at degrees c time post infection also led to substantially different gene expression profiles and this effect varied depending upon the which temperature mosquitoes were exposed to taken together our data indicate temperature significantly modulates mosquito gene expression in response to infection potentially leading to impairment of immune defences at higher ambient temperatures,arthropod borne virus arboviruse dengue zika chikungunya constitute significant proportion global disease burden principal vector pathogen mosquito aede aegypti ability transmit virus human host influence environmental factor temperature however exactly ambient temperature influence virus replication within mosquito remain poorly elucidate particularly molecular level use chikungunya virus chikv model understand host mosquito transcriptome respond arbovirus infection different ambient temperature expose chikv infect mosquito degree degree degree find high temperature correlate high virus replication level particularly early time point post infection low ambient temperature result reduced virus replication level use rnaseq find temperature significantly alter gene expression level mosquitoe particularly component immune response high number significantly differentially express gene response chikv observe degree markedly mute effect observe either low degree high degree temperature high temperature expression many classical immune gene include dicer rnai pathway substantially alter response chikv upregulation toll imd jak stat pathways observe degree time post infection also lead substantially different gene expression profile effect varied depend upon temperature mosquito expose take together datum indicate temperature significantly modulate mosquito gene expression response infection potentially lead impairment immune defence high ambient temperature

Still in 2019, in the same period, 123.407 probable cases of chikungunya were reported, with 15 deaths confirmed by clinical and epidemiological criteria. Regarding Zika, in that period, 10.441 probable cases were recorded, been the northeast region with the highest number of notifications, followed by the midwest one. It is well known that current policies to control the vectors of those arboviruses are not effective. Studies for use of light-activated photosensitizers as an alternative to conventional insecticides for sustainable control of mosquitoes vector such as Aedes (dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, zika), Anopheles (malaria), Culex (yellow fever) can already be found showing advantages over conventional insecticides (efficacy, safety, non-mutagenicity and fast degradation).

ObjectiveTo evaluate the effectiveness of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), mediated by curcumin and blue LED (460nm) in mortality of wild mosquitoes larvae of genus Aedes and also to verify, through confocal microscopy, how the photosensitizer internalizes in larvae organism. In addition to evaluating the action of PDT on the larvae with Raman spectroscopy and histological technique.

Materials and methodsOvitraps were placed in the city of Vitoria da Conquista, Bahia, and the larvae collected in stages L2 and L3 were fed for 24 hours with curcumin in concentrations of 10, 20 and 50% mixed with fish feed and then subjected to irradiation with blue LED for 2h (22mW / cm2 and 158.4 J / cm2). The larvae were placed in a container with dechlorinated water and mortality was monitored for 24 and 48 hours. Control groups in which only the larvae were exposed to blue LED for 2 hours and in which the larvae were only fed with fish feed mixed with curcumin (10, 20 and 50%) were included in the study, in addition to the group without treatment. All experiments were repeated after a 2-month interval to confirm the results, totaling 240 tests (tests 1 and 2, n = 15) between groups PDT 10%, PDT 20%, PDT 50%, curcumin 10%, curcumin 20%, curcumin 50%, blue LED and untreated group. The larvae belonging to the PDT 20% group, 20% curcumin, blue LED and control were submitted to histological slides, confocal microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Larvae mortality rates were compared between groups using univariate descriptive analysis.

ResultsAll PDT groups showed larvicidal activity, with the PDT group 20% showing the highest larval mortality in the shortest time. The images from confocal microscopy by laser scanning showed that curcumin was distributed throughout the digestive system of larvae and the analysis by Raman microspectroscopy have shown patterns of alteration and cell death, corroborated by histological sections.

10.1101/2020.10.27.357418,High-throughput fluorescent assay for inhibitor screening of proteases from RNA viruses,"Spanish flu and other influenza outbreaks, the recent Zika epidemics, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are the most profound examples of severe widespread diseases that are caused by RNA viruses. Perhaps less well known yet dangerous RNA viruses cause deadly diseases such as polio, Ebola, measles, rubella, yellow fever, dengue fever and many others. To combat a particular viral disease by diminishing its spread and number of fatal cases, effective vaccines and antivirals are indispensable. Therefore, quick access to the means of discovery of new treatments for any epidemic outbreak is of great interest and in vitro biochemical assays are the basis of drug discovery. The recent outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) demands an affordable and reliable assay for testing antivirals. Here, we developed a quick and inexpensive high-throughput fluorescent assay to test inhibitors of viral proteases. Accordingly, we employed this assay to sample inhibitors for papain-like protease from SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we validated this assay for screening inhibitors of flaviviral protease from the tick-borne encephalitis virus to emphasize a broad range of applications of our approach. This fluorescent high-throughput assay is based on fluorescent energy transfer (FRET) between two distinct fluorescent proteins (eGFP and mCherry) connected via a substrate polypeptide. When the substrate is cleaved, FRET is abolished and the change in fluorescence corresponds to reaction progress. Our data show that this assay can be used for testing the inhibitors in the 96 or 384 well plates format with robust and reproducible outcomes.",2020-10-28,biochemistry,Dengue,Dengue,spanish flu and other influenza outbreaks the recent zika epidemics and the ongoing covid pandemic are the most profound examples of severe widespread diseases that are caused by rna viruses perhaps less well known yet dangerous rna viruses cause deadly diseases such as polio ebola measles rubella yellow fever dengue fever and many others to combat a particular viral disease by diminishing its spread and number of fatal cases effective vaccines and antivirals are indispensable therefore quick access to the means of discovery of new treatments for any epidemic outbreak is of great interest and in vitro biochemical assays are the basis of drug discovery the recent outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov demands an affordable and reliable assay for testing antivirals here we developed a quick and inexpensive high throughput fluorescent assay to test inhibitors of viral proteases accordingly we employed this assay to sample inhibitors for papain like protease from sars cov in addition we validated this assay for screening inhibitors of flaviviral protease from the tick borne encephalitis virus to emphasize a broad range of applications of our approach this fluorescent high throughput assay is based on fluorescent energy transfer fret between two distinct fluorescent proteins egfp and mcherry connected via a substrate polypeptide when the substrate is cleaved fret is abolished and the change in fluorescence corresponds to reaction progress our data show that this assay can be used for testing the inhibitors in the or well plates format with robust and reproducible outcomes,spanish flu influenza outbreak recent zika epidemic ongoing covid pandemic profound example severe widespread disease cause rna virus perhaps less well know yet dangerous rna virus cause deadly disease polio ebola measle rubella yellow fever dengue fever many other combat particular viral disease diminish spread number fatal case effective vaccine antiviral indispensable therefore quick access mean discovery new treatment epidemic outbreak great interest vitro biochemical assay basis drug discovery recent outbreak coronavirus pandemic cause severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sar cov demand affordable reliable assay testing antiviral develop quick inexpensive high throughput fluorescent assay test inhibitor viral protease accordingly employ assay sample inhibitor papain like protease sar cov addition validate assay screen inhibitor flaviviral protease tick bear encephalitis virus emphasize broad range application approach fluorescent high throughput assay base fluorescent energy transfer fret two distinct fluorescent protein egfp mcherry connect via substrate polypeptide substrate cleave fret abolish change fluorescence correspond reaction progress datum show assay use testing inhibitor well plate format robust reproducible outcome
10.1101/2020.09.23.308817,Defining levels of dengue virus serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies induced by a live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine (TAK-003),"The four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4) infect several hundred million people each year living in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Clinical development of DENV vaccines is difficult because immunity to a single serotype increases risk of severe disease during a second infection with a new serotype. Leading vaccines are based on tetravalent formulations to induce simultaneous and balanced protective immunity to all 4 serotypes. TAK-003 is a tetravalent live attenuated dengue vaccine candidate developed by Takeda Vaccines Inc, which is currently being evaluated in phase 3 efficacy trials. Here, we use antibody depletion methods and chimeric, epitope transplant DENVs to characterize the specificity of neutralizing antibodies in dengue-naive adults and non-human primates immunized with TAK-003. Our results demonstrate that TAK-003 induced high levels of DENV2 neutralizing antibodies that recognized unique (type-specific) epitopes on DENV2. In contrast, most vaccinated subjects developed lower levels of DENV1, DENV3 and DENV4 neutralizing antibodies that mainly targeted epitopes that were conserved (cross-reactive) between serotypes. We conclude that the DENV2 component in the vaccine is immunodominant because of the high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies targeting type-specific epitopes. We also conclude that DENV1, 3 and 4 vaccine components are less immunogenic because most study subjects did not develop type-specific serum neutralizing antibodies to these serotypes. While DENV vaccine development has been guided by the presence of neutralizing antibodies to each serotype as a benchmark, our results indicate that the presence of neutralizing antibodies alone are not a reliable indicator of the immunogenicity of each vaccine component.

Author summaryThe development of tetravalent dengue vaccines has been guided by neutralizing antibodies to each serotype as a correlate of safe and effective vaccine induced immunity. However, the absolute levels of neutralizing antibodies to each serotype has proven to be an unreliable correlate of protection. Levels of antibodies to epitopes that are unique to each serotype, which are measures of immunity independently stimulated by each vaccine component, rather than total quantity of neutralizing antibodies, are likely to be better correlates of protection. Here, we mapped the specificity of antibodies induced by the Takeda tetravalent dengue vaccine TAK-003 in monkeys and humans with no prior immunity to dengue. The TAK-003 vaccine induces high levels of serotype 2 specific neutralizing antibodies that map to known protective epitopes. In contrast, the serotype 1, 3 and 4 neutralizing antibody responses are lower and mainly consist of cross-reactive antibodies binding to epitopes conserved between serotypes. These heterotypic antibodies, which are most likely derived from the serotype 2 component, may not provide long term protection in vivo.",2020-09-24,immunology,Dengue,Dengue,the four dengue virus

10.1101/2020.06.08.139907,"Structural Motifs, Disorder, and the Efficacy of Viral Vaccines","We demonstrate that it is possible to draw direct numerical correlations between virus particles and effective virus-like particle (VLP) derived vaccines through extraction of a Bragg-Williams order parameter from electron microscopy. The method has its roots in studies of disorder in metal alloys, and is adapted to describe the type and occurrence of structural motifs within the arrangement of viral coat proteins, captured by the value of the order parameter as a measure of disorder. A conventional approach to viral vaccine design consists of replicating select proteins to create a VLP designed to trigger an immune response while remaining non-infectious. Understanding variations between viruses and vaccine strains therefore tends to focus on differences between proteins, which can be characterized through genetic analysis. While such an approach provides vital information about the functioning and interactions of the proteins, it does not yet yield an early-stage pathway towards predicting the efficacy of a vaccine, and so large-scale clinical trials are required to obtain critical information. With the urgency associated with pandemics, including Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) originating from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there is a need for earlier indications of whether a vaccine has the necessary characteristics. Application of the methodology to Dengue and influenza virus particles indicates that temperature and pH during incubation could potentially be exploited to fine-tune the order parameter of VLP-based vaccines to match the corresponding virus. Additionally, utilization of an Ising model plot reveals a clear relationship between case fatality rate and order parameter for distinct virus families.",2020-06-08,immunology,Dengue,Dengue,we demonstrate that it is possible to draw direct numerical correlations between virus particles and effective virus like particle vlp derived vaccines through extraction of a bragg williams order parameter from electron microscopy the method has its roots in studies of disorder in metal alloys and is adapted to describe the type and occurrence of structural motifs within the arrangement of viral coat proteins captured by the value of the order parameter as a measure of disorder a conventional approach to viral vaccine design consists of replicating select proteins to create a vlp designed to trigger an immune response while remaining non infectious understanding variations between viruses and vaccine strains therefore tends to focus on differences between proteins which can be characterized through genetic analysis while such an approach provides vital information about the functioning and interactions of the proteins it does not yet yield an early stage pathway towards predicting the efficacy of a vaccine and so large scale clinical trials are required to obtain critical information with the urgency associated with pandemics including coronavirus disease covid originating from the sars cov virus there is a need for earlier indications of whether a vaccine has the necessary characteristics application of the methodology to dengue and influenza virus particles indicates that temperature and ph during incubation could potentially be exploited to fine tune the order parameter of vlp based vaccines to match the corresponding virus additionally utilization of an ising model plot reveals a clear relationship between case fatality rate and order parameter for distinct virus families,demonstrate possible draw direct numerical correlation virus particle effective virus like particle vlp derive vaccine extraction bragg williams order parameter electron microscopy method root study disorder metal alloy adapt describe type occurrence structural motif within arrangement viral coat protein capture value order parameter measure disorder conventional approach viral vaccine design consist replicate select protein create vlp design trigger immune response remain non infectious understanding variation viruse vaccine strain therefore tend focus difference protein characterize genetic analysis approach provide vital information function interaction protein yet yield early stage pathway towards predict efficacy vaccine large scale clinical trial require obtain critical information urgency associate pandemic include coronavirus disease covid originate sar cov virus need early indication whether vaccine necessary characteristic application methodology dengue influenza virus particle indicate temperature incubation could potentially exploit fine tune order parameter vlp base vaccine match correspond virus additionally utilization ise model plot reveal clear relationship case fatality rate order parameter distinct virus family
10.1101/2020.01.12.903062,Activation of Src-family kinases orchestrate secretion of flaviviruses by targeting mature progeny virions to secretory autophagosomes,"Among the various host cellular processes that are hijacked by flaviviruses, very few mechanisms have been described with regard to viral secretion. Here we investigated how flaviviruses exploit the Src family kinases (SFKs) for exit from infected cells. We isolated three members of the SFK family - Src, Fyn and Lyn - that were specifically activated during secretion of Dengue and Zika or their corresponding virus like particles (VLPs). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of the SFKs blocked virus secretion, most significantly upon Lyn-deficiency. Lyn-/- cells were severely impaired in virus release, and were rescued when reconstituted with wild-type Lyn, but not a kinase- or palmitoylation-deficient Lyn mutant. We further established that Lyn, via its palmitoylation-dependent membrane association, triggered post-Golgi virus transport in specialised Rab11 and Transferrin receptor positive organelles resembling secretory autophagosomes, and distinct from conventional exocytic vesicles. In the absence of Lyn activity or its aberrant membrane association, virions were sorted into the lysosomal pathway for degradation. This mode of export was specifically triggered by processed, and mature, but not by furin-resistant virus particles, and occurred with significantly faster kinetics than the conventional secretory pathway. Our study therefore charts a previously undiscovered Lyn-dependent exit strategy, triggered by flaviviruses in secretory autophagosomes that might enable them to evade circulating antibodies and dictate tissue tropism.",2020-01-14,microbiology,Dengue,Dengue,among the various host cellular processes that are hijacked by flaviviruses very few mechanisms have been described with regard to viral secretion here we investigated how flaviviruses exploit the src family kinases sfks for exit from infected cells we isolated three members of the sfk family src fyn and lyn that were specifically activated during secretion of dengue and zika or their corresponding virus like particles vlps pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of the sfks blocked virus secretion most significantly upon lyn deficiency lyn cells were severely impaired in virus release and were rescued when reconstituted with wild type lyn but not a kinase or palmitoylation deficient lyn mutant we further established that lyn via its palmitoylation dependent membrane association triggered post golgi virus transport in specialised rab and transferrin receptor positive organelles resembling secretory autophagosomes and distinct from conventional exocytic vesicles in the absence of lyn activity or its aberrant membrane association virions were sorted into the lysosomal pathway for degradation this mode of export was specifically triggered by processed and mature but not by furin resistant virus particles and occurred with significantly faster kinetics than the conventional secretory pathway our study therefore charts a previously undiscovered lyn dependent exit strategy triggered by flaviviruses in secretory autophagosomes that might enable them to evade circulating antibodies and dictate tissue tropism,among various host cellular process hijack flavivirus mechanism describe regard viral secretion investigate flavivirus exploit src family kinase sfks exit infect cell isolate three member sfk family src fyn lyn specifically activate secretion dengue zika correspond virus like particle vlps pharmacological inhibition genetic depletion sfks block virus secretion significantly upon lyn deficiency lyn cell severely impair virus release rescue reconstitute wild type lyn kinase palmitoylation deficient lyn mutant establish lyn via palmitoylation dependent membrane association trigger post golgi virus transport specialised rab transferrin receptor positive organelle resemble secretory autophagosome distinct conventional exocytic vesicle absence lyn activity aberrant membrane association virion sort lysosomal pathway degradation mode export specifically trigger process mature furin resistant virus particle occur significantly fast kinetic conventional secretory pathway study therefore chart previously undiscovered lyn dependent exit strategy trigger flavivirus secretory autophagosome might enable evade circulate antibody dictate tissue tropism

Despite the presence of NS1 in blood, Dengue is asymptomatic and self-limiting in [&ge;]80% Dengue virus (DV) infected people. We investigated this observation and found that plasmid-mediated NS1 expression and secretion in liver cells (Huh7) are sufficient to cause programmed cell death (apoptosis) and associated cellular DNA breakage. However, liver or kidney cell lines infected with DV and secreting equivalent amounts of NS1 didnt exhibit apoptotic DNA breakage. In fact, DV-infected cells showed better survival than cells in which only NS1 was transiently expressed by transfection. We also found that DV can even prevent chemical-induced apoptotic DNA damage in infected host cells. So, DV thwarts host antiviral defence i.e. apoptosis, by counteracting cellular DNA breakages and keeps the infected cells metabolically active to prolong virus replication.",2020-06-20,microbiology,Dengue,Dengue,ns a virotoxin abundantly present in dengue patients blood is a major player behind disease patho biogenesis including plasma leakage and damage to the liver despite the presence of ns in blood dengue is asymptomatic and self limiting in ge dengue virus dv infected people we investigated this observation and found that plasmid mediated ns expression and secretion in liver cells huh are sufficient to cause programmed cell death apoptosis and associated cellular dna breakage however liver or kidney cell lines infected with dv and secreting equivalent amounts of ns didnt exhibit apoptotic dna breakage in fact dv infected cells showed better survival than cells in which only ns was transiently expressed by transfection we also found that dv can even prevent chemical induced apoptotic dna damage in infected host cells so dv thwarts host antiviral defence i e apoptosis by counteracting cellular dna breakages and keeps the infected cells metabolically active to prolong virus replication,virotoxin abundantly present dengue patient blood major player behind disease patho biogenesis include plasma leakage damage liver despite presence blood dengue asymptomatic self limit dengue virus infect people investigate observation find plasmid mediate expression secretion liver cell huh sufficient cause program cell death apoptosis associate cellular dna breakage however liver kidney cell line infect secrete equivalent amount do not exhibit apoptotic dna breakage fact infect cell show well survival cell transiently express transfection also find even prevent chemical induce apoptotic dna damage infect host cell thwart host antiviral defence apoptosis counteract cellular dna breakage keep infected cell metabolically active prolong virus replication
10.1101/2020.04.30.070250,Systematic mutational analysis of epitope-grafted ED3's immunogenicity reveals a DENV3-DENV4 bi-serospecific ED3 mutant,"Dengue viruses are classified into four serotypes (DENV1[~]4), and the severe forms of dengue disease, the dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome, are caused by sero-cross-reacting antibodies. However, the residue determinants of the serospecificity and sero-cross-reactivity are yet to be identified. Here, we report an epitope grafting mutational analysis of the serospecificity and cross-serospecificity of the envelope protein domain 3 (ED3; 107 residues, [~]11.6kDa), which contains two major putative epitopes of DENVs. To this end, we constructed ED3 from DENV3 (3ED3) and DENV4 (4ED3), and six epitope-grafted variants, where we transferred epitope 1 (L304I, K305D, V309M, and S310A) and/or epitope 2 (D383N, K384S, K387T, and N389H) of 4ED3 onto 3ED3 and vice versa. Mice immunization using 3ED3 and 4ED3 generated serotype-specific antisera, as expected. Similarly, most epitope-grafted ED3s produced antisera serospecific to the template ED3 with little or no cross-recognition of ED3 of the serotype from which the epitopes were taken. This result indicated that a mere grafting of the epitope was not sufficient to transfer serospecificity, contrary to our expectations. However, one epitope grafted ED3 mutant, where epitope 1 of 3ED3 was grafted onto 4ED3 (4ED3epi1), generated antisera that was serospecific to both 4ED3 and 3ED3. The 4ED3epi1 is thus a chimeric ED3 that produces antisera possessing serospecificity to both 3ED3 and 4ED3. The 4ED3epi1 provides a unique tool for analyzing serospecificity and cross-reactivity in dengue, and we hope it will serve as a template for trivalent and eventually tetravalent antisera.",2020-04-30,immunology,Dengue,Dengue,dengue viruses are classified into four serotypes denv and the severe forms of dengue disease the dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome are caused by sero cross reacting antibodies however the residue determinants of the serospecificity and sero cross reactivity are yet to be identified here we report an epitope grafting mutational analysis of the serospecificity and cross serospecificity of the envelope protein domain ed residues kda which contains two major putative epitopes of denvs to this end we constructed ed from denv ed and denv ed and six epitope grafted variants where we transferred epitope l i k d v m and s a and or epitope d n k s k t and n h of ed onto ed and vice versa mice immunization using ed and ed generated serotype specific antisera as expected similarly most epitope grafted ed s produced antisera serospecific to the template ed with little or no cross recognition of ed of the serotype from which the epitopes were taken this result indicated that a mere grafting of the epitope was not sufficient to transfer serospecificity contrary to our expectations however one epitope grafted ed mutant where epitope of ed was grafted onto ed ed epi generated antisera that was serospecific to both ed and ed the ed epi is thus a chimeric ed that produces antisera possessing serospecificity to both ed and ed the ed epi provides a unique tool for analyzing serospecificity and cross reactivity in dengue and we hope it will serve as a template for trivalent and eventually tetravalent antisera,dengue virus classify four serotype denv severe form dengue disease dengue hemorrhagic fever shock syndrome cause sero cross react antibody however residue determinant serospecificity sero cross reactivity yet identify report epitope graft mutational analysis serospecificity cross serospecificity envelope protein domain residue kda contain two major putative epitope denvs end construct denv denv six epitope graft variant transfer epitope epitope onto vice versa mouse immunization use generate serotype specific antisera expect similarly epitope graft produce antisera serospecific template little cross recognition serotype epitope take result indicate mere grafting epitope sufficient transfer serospecificity contrary expectation however one epitope graft mutant epitope graft onto epi generate antisera serospecific epi thus chimeric produce antisera possess serospecificity epi provide unique tool analyze serospecificity cross reactivity dengue hope serve template trivalent eventually tetravalent antisera
10.1101/740829,"A new knockdown resistance (kdr) mutation, F1534L, in the voltage-gated sodium channel of Aedes aegypti, co-occurring with F1534C, S989P and V1016G","BackgroundAedes aegypti is a primary vector of dengue, chikungunya and zika infections in India. In the absence of specific drugs or safe and effective vaccines for these infections, their control relies mainly on vector control measures. The emergence of insecticide resistance in vectors, especially against pyrethroids, is a serious threat to the insecticide-based vector control programme. This study reports the presence of multiple knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations present in an Ae. aegypti population from Bengaluru (India), including a new mutation F1534L.

MethodsAedes aegypti collected from Bengaluru were subjected to insecticide susceptibility tests with DDT, deltamethrin and permethrin. The DNA sequencing of partial domain II, III and IV of the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) was performed to screen kdr mutations present in the population and PCR-based assays were developed for their detection. Genotyping of kdr mutations was done using PCR-based assays, allelic frequencies were determined, and tests of genetic association of kdr mutations with the insecticide resistance phenotype were performed.

ResultsThe Ae. aegypti population were resistant to DDT, deltamethrin and permethrin. The DNA sequencing of the VGSC revealed the presence of four kdr mutations, i.e., S989P and V1016G in domain II and two alternative kdr mutations F1534C and F1534L in domain III. Allele-specific PCR assays (ASPCR) were developed for the detection of kdr mutations S989P and V1016G and an existing PCR-RFLP based strategy was modified for the genotyping of all three known kdr mutations in domain III (F1534L, F1534C and T1520I). Genotyping of Ae. aegypti samples collected between October 2014 and April 2015 revealed a moderate frequency of S989P/V1016G (18.27%) and F1534L (17.48%), a relatively high frequency of F1534C (50.61%) and absence of T1520I in the population. Mutations S989P and V1016G were in complete linkage disequilibrium in this population while they were in linkage equilibrium with kdr mutations F1534C and F1534L. The alleles F1534C and F1534L are genetically associated with permethrin resistance.

ConclusionsA new kdr mutation, F1534L, was found in an Ae. aegypti population from Bengaluru (India), co-occurring with the other three mutations S989P, V1016G and F1534C. The findings of a new mutation and development of PCR-based diagnostics have implications for insecticide resistance management.

10.1101/708743,"Interdependence between confirmed and discarded cases of dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses in Brazil: A multivariate time-series analysis","The co-circulation of different arboviruses in the same time and space poses a significant threat to public health given their rapid geographic dispersion and serious health, social, and economic impact. Therefore, it is crucial to have high quality of case registration to estimate the real impact of each arboviruses in the population. In this work, a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model was developed to investigate the interrelationships between discarded and confirmed cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Brazil. We used data from the Brazilian National Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) from 2010 to 2017. There were three peaks in the series of dengue notification in this period occurring in 2013, 2015 and in 2016. The series of reported cases of both Zika and chikungunya reached their peak in late 2015 and early 2016. The VAR model shows that the Zika series have a significant impact on the dengue series and vice versa, suggesting that several discarded and confirmed cases of dengue could actually have been cases of Zika. The model also suggests that the series of confirmed and discarded chikungunya cases are almost independent of the cases of Zika, however, affecting the series of dengue. In conclusion, co-circulation of arboviruses with similar symptoms could have lead to misdiagnosed diseases in the surveillance system. We argue that the routinely use of mathematical and statistical models in association with traditional symptom-surveillance could help to decrease such errors and to provide early indication of possible future outbreaks. These findings address the challenges regarding notification biases and shed new light on how to handle reported cases based only in clinical-epidemiological criteria when multiples arboviruses co-circulate in the same population.

Author summaryArthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) transmission is a growing health problem worldwide. The real epidemiological impact of the co-circulation of different arboviruses in the same urban spaces is a recent phenomenon and there are many issues to explore. One of them is the misclassification due to the scarce availability of confirmatory laboratory tests. This establishes a challenge to identify, distinguish and estimate the number of infections when different arboviruses co-circulate. We propose the use of multivariate time series analysis to understand how the weekly notification of suspected cases of dengue, chikungunya and Zika, in Brazil, affected each other. Our results suggest that the series of Zika significantly impact on the series of dengue and vice versa, indicating that several discarded and confirmed cases of dengue might actually have been Zika cases. The results also suggest that the series of confirmed cases of chikungunya are almost independent of those of dengue and Zika. Our findings shed light on yet hidden aspects on the co-circulation of these three viruses based on reported cases.

Here, we serologically profiled 20 non-human primates (NHP) from a prior study of DENV1 infection in which the animals were inoculated by mosquito (N=10) or subcutaneous injection (N=10). Using a comprehensive, densely tiled and highly redundant pan-flavivirus programmable phage library containing 91,562 overlapping 62 amino acid peptides, we produced a high-resolution map of linear peptide sequences enriched during DENV seroconversion. We found that serological profiles in mosquito-inoculated and subcutaneously-inoculated animals were similar up to 90 days after primary infection, but diverged at 1 year. We found differences in sero-reactivity, as indicated by the median area under the curve (AUC) in the Envelope (E; residues 215-406; p < 0.08), and Nonstructural-3 (NS3; residues 549-615; p < 0.05) proteins in mosquito-inoculated versus subcutaneously-inoculated animals. Within the E protein, residues 339-384 in domain III accounted for >99% of the total AUC difference across residues 215-406. Antibody breadth did not vary by mode of inoculation. The differential reactivity to E domain III (EDIII) seen by phage display validated orthogonally by ELISA, but did not correlate with late neutralization titers. Serological profiling of humoral immune responses to DENV infection in NHP by programmable phage display demonstrated durable differences in sero-reactivity by route of inoculation. These findings could have implications for DENV diagnostics and evaluation of vaccines.

IMPORTANCEDengue virus (DENV) infections are transmitted by mosquito bite, but how being infected by mosquito bite affects the immune response is not known. In this study, we analyzed antibodies produced by rhesus macaques infected with DENV using programmable phage display, a high-throughput method for characterizing what viral protein derived peptides serum antibodies bind to. We found that while there was no difference in antibody binding profiles at early timepoints post-infection, at one year post-infection, there were substantial differences in the antibody binding profiles of macaques who were infected by mosquito bite versus those that were infected by injection. In general, antibodies in the macaques inoculated by mosquito maintained higher levels of sero-reactivity, with a strong signal still present one year post-infection.

For climate-sensitive diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, climate appears to have opposing effects in different contexts. Here we show that a model, parameterized with laboratory measured climate-driven mosquito physiology, captures three key epidemic characteristics across ecologically and culturally distinct settings in Ecuador and Kenya: the number, timing, and duration of outbreaks. The model generates a range of disease dynamics consistent with observed Aedes aegypti abundances and laboratory-confirmed arboviral incidence with variable accuracy (28 - 85% for vectors, 44 - 88% for incidence). The model predicted vector dynamics better in sites with a smaller proportion of young children in the population, lower mean temperature, and homes with piped water and made of cement.

10.1101/2020.02.13.948208,A Critical Role for Perivascular Cells in Amplifying Viral Haemorrhage Induced by Dengue Virus Non-Structural Protein 1,"Dengue is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease affecting humans, with severe dengue typified by potentially fatal microvascular leakage and hypovolaemic shock. Blood vessels of the microvasculature are composed of a tubular structure of endothelial cells ensheathed by perivascular cells (pericytes). Pericytes support endothelial cell barrier formation and maintenance through paracrine and contact-mediated signalling, and are critical to microvascular integrity. Pericyte dysfunction has been linked to vascular leakage in noncommunicable pathologies such as diabetic retinopathy, but has never been linked to infection-related vascular leakage. Dengue vascular leakage has been shown to result in part from the direct action of the secreted dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein NS1 on endothelial cells. Using primary human vascular cells, we show here that NS1 also causes pericyte dysfunction, and that NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability is more pronounced in the presence of pericytes. Notably, NS1 specifically disrupted the ability of pericytes to support endothelial cell function in a 3D microvascular assay, with no effect on pericyte viability or physiology. These effects are mediated at least in part through contact-independent paracrine signals involved in endothelial barrier maintenance by pericytes. We therefore identify a role for pericytes in amplifying NS1-induced microvascular hyperpermeability in severe dengue, and thus show that pericytes can play a critical role in the aetiology of an infectious vascular leakage syndrome. These findings open new avenues of research for the development of drugs and diagnostic assays for combating infection-induced vascular leakage, such as severe dengue.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe World Health Organisation considers dengue one of the top ten global public health problems. There is no specific antiviral therapy to treat dengue virus and no way of predicting which patients will develop potentially fatal severe dengue, typified by vascular leakage and circulatory shock. We show here that perivascular cells (pericytes) amplify the vascular leakage-inducing effects of the dengue viral protein NS1 through contact-independent signalling to endothelial cells. While pericytes are known to contribute to noncommunicable vascular leakage, this is the first time these cells have been implicated in the vascular effects of an infectious disease.

Herein, we identified 2 secreted bacterial lipases from a Chromobacterium bacterium, named Chromobacterium antiviral effector-1 (CbAE-1) and CbAE-2, with a broad-spectrum virucidal activity against dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). The CbAEs potently blocked viral infection in the extracellular milieu through their lipase activity. Mechanistic studies showed that this lipase activity directly disrupted the viral envelope structure, thus inactivating infectivity. A mutation of CbAE-1 in its lipase motif fully abrogated the virucidal ability.

10.1101/2020.06.26.172668,A new subclass of exoribonuclease resistant RNA found in multiple Flaviviridae genera,"Viruses have developed innovative strategies to exploit the cellular machinery and overcome the host antiviral defenses, often using specifically structured RNA elements. Examples are found in flaviviruses; during flaviviral infection, pathogenic subgenomic flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) accumulate in the cell. These sfRNAs are formed when a host cell 5 to 3 exoribonuclease degrades the viral genomic RNA but is blocked by an exoribonuclease resistant RNA structure (xrRNA) located in the viral genomes 3untranslated region (UTR). Although known to exist in several Flaviviridae genera the full distribution and diversity of xRNAs in this virus family was unknown. Using the recent high-resolution structure of an xrRNA from the divergent flavivirus Tamana bat virus (TABV) as a reference, we used bioinformatic searches to identify xrRNA in the Pegivirus, Pestivirus, and Hepacivirus genera. We biochemically and structurally characterized several examples, determining that they are genuine xrRNAs with a conserved fold. These new xrRNAs look superficially similar to the previously described xrRNAs but possess structural differences making them distinct from previous classes of xrRNAs. Our findings thus require adjustments of previous xrRNA classification schemes and expand on the previously known distribution of the xrRNA in Flaviviridae, indicating their widespread distribution and illustrating their importance.

IMPORTANCEThe Flaviviridae comprise one of the largest families of positive sense single stranded (+ssRNA) and it is divided into the Flavivirus, Pestivirus, Pegivirus, and Hepacivirus genera. The genus Flavivirus contains many medically relevant viruses such as Zika Virus, Dengue Virus, and Powassan Virus. In these, a part of the viruss RNA twists up into a very special three-dimensional shape called an xrRNA that blocks the ability of the cell to ""chew up"" the viral RNA. Hence, part of the virus RNA remains intact, and this protected part is important for viral infection. This was known to occur in Flaviviruses but whether it existed in the other members of the family was not known. In this study, we not only identified a new subclass of xrRNA found in Flavivirus but also in the remaining three genera. The fact that this process of viral RNA maturation exists throughout the entire Flaviviridae family makes it clear that this is an important but underappreciated part of the infection strategy of these diverse human pathogens.",2020-06-26,microbiology,Dengue,Dengue,viruses have developed innovative strategies to exploit the cellular machinery and overcome the host antiviral defenses often using specifically structured rna elements examples are found in flaviviruses during flaviviral infection pathogenic subgenomic flaviviral rnas sfrnas accumulate in the cell these sfrnas are formed when a host cell to exoribonuclease degrades the viral genomic rna but is blocked by an exoribonuclease resistant rna structure xrrna located in the viral genomes untranslated region utr although known to exist in several flaviviridae genera the full distribution and diversity of xrnas in this virus family was unknown using the recent high resolution structure of an xrrna from the divergent flavivirus tamana bat virus tabv as a reference we used bioinformatic searches to identify xrrna in the pegivirus pestivirus and hepacivirus genera we biochemically and structurally characterized several examples determining that they are genuine xrrnas with a conserved fold these new xrrnas look superficially similar to the previously described xrrnas but possess structural differences making them distinct from previous classes of xrrnas our findings thus require adjustments of previous xrrna classification schemes and expand on the previously known distribution of the xrrna in flaviviridae indicating their widespread distribution and illustrating their importance importancethe flaviviridae comprise one of the largest families of positive sense single stranded ssrna and it is divided into the flavivirus pestivirus pegivirus and hepacivirus genera the genus flavivirus contains many medically relevant viruses such as zika virus dengue virus and powassan virus in these a part of the viruss rna twists up into a very special three dimensional shape called an xrrna that blocks the ability of the cell to chew up the viral rna hence part of the virus rna remains intact and this protected part is important for viral infection this was known to occur in flaviviruses but whether it existed in the other members of the family was not known in this study we not only identified a new subclass of xrrna found in flavivirus but also in the remaining three genera the fact that this process of viral rna maturation exists throughout the entire flaviviridae family makes it clear that this is an important but underappreciated part of the infection strategy of these diverse human pathogens,virus develop innovative strategy exploit cellular machinery overcome host antiviral defense often use specifically structure rna element example find flavivirus flaviviral infection pathogenic subgenomic flaviviral rnas sfrnas accumulate cell sfrna form host cell exoribonuclease degrade viral genomic rna block exoribonuclease resistant rna structure xrrna locate viral genome untranslated region utr although known exist several flaviviridae genera full distribution diversity xrnas virus family unknown use recent high resolution structure xrrna divergent flavivirus tamana bat virus tabv reference use bioinformatic search identify xrrna pegivirus pestivirus hepacivirus genera biochemically structurally characterize several example determine genuine xrrna conserve fold new xrrna look superficially similar previously describe xrrna possess structural difference make distinct previous class xrrna finding thus require adjustment previous xrrna classification scheme expand previously know distribution xrrna flaviviridae indicate widespread distribution illustrate importance importancethe flaviviridae comprise one large family positive sense single strand ssrna divide flavivirus pestivirus pegivirus hepacivirus genera genus flavivirus contain many medically relevant virus zika virus dengue virus powassan virus part viruss rna twist special three dimensional shape call xrrna block ability cell chew viral rna hence part virus rna remain intact protect part important viral infection know occur flavivirus whether exist member family know study identify new subclass xrrna find flavivirus also remain three genera fact process viral rna maturation exist throughout entire flaviviridae family make clear important underappreciated part infection strategy diverse human pathogen

In contrast, the role of mTORC2 in viral pathogenesis is unknown. In this study, we explore the consequences of a physical protein-protein interaction between dengue non-structural protein 5 (NS5) and host cell mTOR proteins during infection. Using shRNA to differentially target mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes, we show that mTORC2 is required for optimal dengue replication. Furthermore, we show that mTORC2 is activated during viral replication, and that mTORC2 counteracts virus-induced apoptosis, promoting the survival of infected cells.

10.1101/2020.06.10.144089,<h1>The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 is essential for Dengue virus infection <o:p></o:p></h1>,"Dengue virus (DENV) causes the most prevalent and rapidly spreading arboviral disease of humans. It enters human cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Numerous cell surface proteins have been proposed as DENV entry factors. Among these, the phosphatidylserine receptor TIM-1 is the only one known to mediate virus internalization. However, several cellular models lacking TIM-1 are permissive to DENV infection, suggesting that other receptors exist. Here we show that the Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) binds DENV virions by interacting with the DIII of the viral envelope glycoprotein. DENV infection is effectively inhibited by the purified receptor at 5x10-8 mol/L and the interaction of the envelope protein with LRP1 is also blocked by a natural ligand of LRP1. Depletion of LRP1 causes 100-fold lower production of infectious virus than controls. Our results indicate that LRP1 is another DENV receptor thus, becoming an attractive target to evaluate for the development of effective antiviral drugs against DENV.

Author summaryDengue virus (DENV) is a complex of four related viruses, recognized as serotypes, designated as DENV1-4. Any of the four DENV serotypes can cause a self-limited disease of mild flu-like symptoms known as dengue or its life threatening form, severe dengue, with hemorrhagic manifestations, organ impairment and shock. This disease is widely spread in tropical and sub-tropical areas worldwide, where the incidence of severe dengue has been increasing steadily. So far, efforts that target components of the viral replication machinery in order to develop a specific antiviral drug for dengue disease patients have failed. Thus, identifying the cell surface receptors used by DENV to enter host cells would provide a new molecular target to develop inhibitory drugs. Here, we evaluate the Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) as a putative DENV receptor. We present evidence demonstrating that LRP1 binds DENV through the viral envelope protein. We show that the production of infective virus is impaired on cells lacking LRP1, and that purified LRP1 is a potent blocker of DENV infection.

The controversial live attenuated virus vaccine Dengvaxia has boosted the pursuit of sub-unit vaccine approaches, and the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) has recently emerged as a promising candidate. However, we found that NS1 immunization or passive transfer of NS1 antibodies failed to confer protection in symptomatic dengue mouse models using two non mouse-adapted DENV2 strains from the Cosmopolitan genotype that currently circulates in South-East Asia. Furthermore, exogenous administration of purified NS1 did not worsen in vivo vascular leakage in sub-lethally infected mice, thereby supporting that NS1 does not play a critical role in the pathogenesis of these DENV2 strains. Virus chimerization approaches indicated that the prME structural region, but not NS1, plays a critical role in driving in vivo fitness and virulence of the virus, through induction of key pro-inflammatory cytokines.

We compared the Malaysia weekly epidemiological records of dengue incidences during the period of lockdown to the trend of previous years (2015 to 2019) and a simulation at the corresponding period that expected no movement restrictions. We found that the dengue incidence declined significantly with a greater magnitude at phase 1 of lockdown, with a negative gradient of 3.2-fold steeper than the trend observed in previous years and 6.5-fold steeper than the simulation, indicating that the control of population movement did reduce dengue transmission. However, starting from phase 2 of lockdown, the dengue incidences demonstrated an elevation and earlier rebound by at least 4 weeks and grew with an exponential pattern compared to the simulation and previous years. Together with our data on Aedes mosquitoes from a district of Penang, Malaysia, we revealed that Aedes albopictus is the predominant species for both indoor and outdoor environments. The abundance of the mosquito was increasing steadily during the period of lockdown, and demonstrated strong correlation with the locally reported dengue incidences; therefore, we proposed the possible diffusive effect of vector that led to a higher acceleration of incidence rate.

10.1101/2020.07.09.194993,A targeted computational screen of the SWEETLEAD database reveals FDA-approved compounds with anti-dengue viral activity,"Affordable and effective antiviral therapies are needed worldwide, especially against agents such as dengue virus that are endemic in underserved regions. Many antiviral compounds have been studied in cultured cells but are unsuitable for clinical applications due to pharmacokinetic profiles, side effects, or inconsistent efficacy across dengue serotypes. Such tool compounds can, however, aid in identifying clinically useful treatments. Here, computational screening (Rapid Overlay of Chemical Structures) was used to identify entries in an in silico database of safe-in-human compounds (SWEETLEAD) that display high chemical similarities to known inhibitors of dengue virus. Molecules known to inhibit dengue proteinase NS2B/3, dengue capsid, and the host autophagy pathway were used as query compounds. Following computational and initial virological screening, three FDA-approved compounds that resemble the tool molecules structurally, cause little toxicity and display strong antiviral activity in cultured cells were selected for further analysis. Pyrimethamine (IC50 = 1.2 µM), like the dengue proteinase inhibitor ARDP0006 to which it shows structural similarity, inhibited intramolecular NS2B/3 cleavage. Lack of toxicity allowed testing in mice, in which pyrimethamine also reduced viral loads. Niclosamide (IC50 = 0.28 µM), like dengue core inhibitor ST-148, affected structural components of the virion and inhibited early processes during infection. Vandetanib (IC50 = 1.6 µM), like cellular autophagy inhibitor spautin-1, blocked viral exit from cells and could further be shown to extend survival in vivo. Our approach confirmed previous studies which used extensive high-throughput screening to identify niclosamide and pyrimethamine as antivirals, and it also revealed their likely molecular targets. Thus, three FDA-approved compounds with promising utility for repurposing to treat dengue virus infections and their potential mechanisms were identified using computational tools and minimal phenotypic screening.Author Summary No antiviral therapeutics are currently available for dengue virus infections. By computationally overlaying the 3D chemical structures of compounds known to inhibit dengue virus with those of compounds known to be safe in humans, we identified three FDA-approved compounds that are attractive candidates for drug repurposing towards treatment of dengue virus infections. We identified potential targets of two previously identified antiviral compounds and revealed a previously unknown potential anti-dengue drug, vandetanib. This computational approach to analyze a highly curated library of structures has the benefits of speed and cost efficiency. It also leverages mechanistic work with query compounds used in biomedical research to provide strong hypotheses for the antiviral mechanisms of the safer hit compounds. This workflow to identify compounds with known safety profiles in humans can be expanded to any biological activity for which a small-molecule query compound has been identified, potentially

Identifying mutations that make DENV more competent for transmission by Ae. albopictus will help to predict emergence of epidemic strains. Ten serial passages in vivo in Ae. albopictus led to select DENV-1 strains with greater infectivity for this vector in vivo and in cultured mosquito cells. These changes were mediated by multiple adaptive mutations in the virus genome, including a mutation at position 10,418 in the DENV 3UTR within an RNA stem-loop structure involved in subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) production. Using reverse genetics, we showed that the 10,418 mutation alone does not confer a detectable increase in transmission efficiency in vivo.

This antibody was specific to the DENV that lacks N-67 glycan, including the Mochizuki strain. Interestingly, the Mochizuki strain acquired N-67 glycan by 7F4 selective pressure. DENVs might have evolved to escape from this antibody considering that most of currently circulating DENVs possess N-67 glycan. However, this suggests that 7F4 epitope might be useless as a vaccine target.

Seriousness of the viral infection can be attributed to its lethality when not treated in time and potential to cause health complications post infection. Currently there are only preventive strategies and development of vaccination is still in its infancy of research. It is therefore highly necessary to discover newer drugs and therapies for this deadly virus. In this paper we report important insights we have obtained through a computational analysis of small molecules of Neem (Azadirachta indica) against dengue viral proteins and its required proteins in human. Our study involves identification of the effect of specific small molecules of Neem on proteins of human and virus corresponding to different pathways using simulated molecular binding analyses. We report here Gedunin and Pongamol contained in naturally occurring Neem as potential drugs against the Dengue virus.

10.1101/2020.10.29.360651,"Sexual selection theory meets disease vector control: Testing harmonic convergence as a ""good genes"" signal in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes","The mosquito Aedes aegypti is a medically important, globally distributed vector of the viruses that cause dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika. Although reproduction and mate choice are key components of vector population dynamics and control, our understanding of the mechanisms of sexual selection in mosquitoes remains poor. In ""good genes"" models of sexual selection, females use male cues as an indicator of both mate and offspring inherent genetic quality. Recent studies in Ae. aegypti provide evidence that male wingbeat acoustics signal aspects of offspring quality and performance during mate selection in a process known as harmonic convergence. However, the extent to which harmonic convergence may signal overall inherent quality of mates and their offspring remains unknown. To examine this, we measured the potential acoustic signaling and heritability of a broad panel of parent and offspring fitness traits in two generations of field-derived Ae. aegypti originating from dengue endemic field sites in Thailand. Our data show that in this population of mosquitoes, harmonic convergence does not signal male fertility, female fecundity, and male flight performance traits, which despite displaying robust variability in both parents and their offspring were only weakly heritable. Together with previous work, our findings suggest that vector reproductive control programs should treat harmonic convergence as an indicator of some, but not all aspects of inherent quality, and that multiple forms of sexual selection are likely at play in Ae. aegypti in a trait, population, and environment dependent manner.",2020-10-29,ecology,Dengue,Dengue,the mosquito aedes aegypti is a medically important globally distributed vector of the viruses that cause dengue yellow fever chikungunya and zika although reproduction and mate choice are key components of vector population dynamics and control our understanding of the mechanisms of sexual selection in mosquitoes remains poor in good genes models of sexual selection females use male cues as an indicator of both mate and offspring inherent genetic quality recent studies in ae aegypti provide evidence that male wingbeat acoustics signal aspects of offspring quality and performance during mate selection in a process known as harmonic convergence however the extent to which harmonic convergence may signal overall inherent quality of mates and their offspring remains unknown to examine this we measured the potential acoustic signaling and heritability of a broad panel of parent and offspring fitness traits in two generations of field derived ae aegypti originating from dengue endemic field sites in thailand our data show that in this population of mosquitoes harmonic convergence does not signal male fertility female fecundity and male flight performance traits which despite displaying robust variability in both parents and their offspring were only weakly heritable together with previous work our findings suggest that vector reproductive control programs should treat harmonic convergence as an indicator of some but not all aspects of inherent quality and that multiple forms of sexual selection are likely at play in ae aegypti in a trait population and environment dependent manner,mosquito aedes aegypti medically important globally distribute vector virus cause dengue yellow fever chikungunya zika although reproduction mate choice key component vector population dynamic control understand mechanism sexual selection mosquito remain poor good gene model sexual selection female use male cue indicator mate offspre inherent genetic quality recent study aegypti provide evidence male wingbeat acoustic signal aspect offspring quality performance mate selection process know harmonic convergence however extent harmonic convergence may signal overall inherent quality mate offspring remain unknown examine measure potential acoustic signal heritability broad panel parent offspring fitness trait two generation field derive aegypti originate dengue endemic field site thailand data show population mosquito harmonic convergence signal male fertility female fecundity male flight performance trait despite display robust variability parent offspring weakly heritable together previous work finding suggest vector reproductive control program treat harmonic convergence indicator aspect inherent quality multiple form sexual selection likely play aegypti trait population environment dependent manner
10.1101/2020.05.13.093880,Genome-wide identification of Aedes albopictus long noncoding RNAs and their association with dengue and zika virus infection,"The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Ae. albopictus), is an important vector that transmits arboviruses such as dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV) and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). On the other hand, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to regulate various biological processes. Knowledge on Ae. albopictus lncRNAs and their functional role in virus-host interactions are still limited. Here, we identified and characterized the lncRNAs in the genome of an arbovirus vector, Ae. albopictus, and evaluated their potential involvement in DENV and ZIKV infection. We used 148 public datasets, and identified a total of 10, 867 novel lncRNA transcripts, of which 5,809, 4,139, and 919 were intergenic, intronic and antisense respectively. The Ae. albopictus lncRNAs shared many characteristics with other species such as short length, low GC content, and low sequence conservation. RNA-sequencing of Ae. albopictus cells infected with DENV and ZIKV showed that the expression of lncRNAs was altered upon virus infection. Target prediction analysis revealed that Ae. albopictus lncRNAs may regulate the expression of genes involved in immunity and other metabolic and cellular processes. To verify the role of lncRNAs in virus infection, we generated mutation in lncRNA loci using CRISPR-Cas9, and discovered that two lncRNA loci mutations, namely XLOC_029733 (novel lncRNA transcript id: lncRNA_27639.2) and LOC115270134 (known lncRNA transcript id: XR_003899061.1) resulted in enhancement of DENV and ZIKV replication. The results presented here provide an important foundation for future studies of lncRNAs and their relationship with virus infection in Ae. albopictus.

Author summaryAe. albopictus is an important vector of arboviruses such as dengue and Zika. Studies on virus-host interaction at gene expression and molecular level are crucial especially in devising methods to inhibit virus replication in Aedes mosquito. Previous reports showed that, besides protein-coding genes, noncoding RNAs such as lncRNAs are also involved in virus-host interaction. In this study, we report a comprehensive catalog of novel lncRNA transcripts in the genome of Ae. albopictus. We also show that the expression of lncRNAs was altered upon infection with dengue and Zika. Additionally, depletion of certain lncRNAs resulted in increased replication of dengue and Zika; hence, suggesting potential association of lncRNAs in virus infection.

Innovative approaches to control Aedes populations, involving synthetic transgenic modifications as well as Wolbachia bacteria, appear promising. For the various techniques requiring offspring inheritance of a trait, released males must successfully compete for mating partners against wildtype males. However, very little is known about mechanisms of mate selection in mosquitoes in general and in particular about potential correlations between mating success and offspring immune performance.

Harmonic convergence signals have been proposed as a cue for females to predict male quality. We investigated whether offspring of converging parental pairs showed differences in immune competence compared to offspring derived from non-converging parental pairs using three different types of immune assays. We found that offspring immune responses (melanization response and response to a bacterial challenge) differed between offspring from converging and non-converging parents. However, immune responses were shaped by several interacting factors such as sex, age, reproductive status, and parental mating behavior. Parental mating behavior had a stronger effect on the immune response of male offspring than on female offspring. Further, a population of female offspring derived from converging parental pairs reached their peak dengue virus dissemination rate earlier compared to a population of offspring derived from non-converging parental pairs. Our results provide insight into a wide range of selective pressures shaping mosquito immune function.

Therefore, this work set out to estimate its current and future potential geographic distribution under the Representative Concentration Paths (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 emission scenarios by 2050 and 2070, using ecological niche models. For this, predictions were made in MaxEnt, employing occurrences of A. albopictus from their native area and South America and bioclimatic variables of these places. It was found that, since its invasion to Colombia, A. albopictus is present in 47% of the country, in peri-urban (20%), rural (23%), and urban (57%) areas between 0 and 1800 m, with Antioquia and Valle del Cauca being the departments with the most registries. The current estimation suggests that A. albopictus is distributed in 96% of the territory up to 3000 m (p < 0.001). Additionally, by 2050 and 2070, below RCP 2.6, its distribution could diminish to nearly 90% including altitudes of 3100 m, while below RCP 8.5 it would be < 60% increasing its distribution up to 3200 m. These results suggest that, currently in Colombia, A. albopictus is found throughout the country and climate change could diminish eventually its area of distribution, but increase its altitudinal range.

10.1101/607267,Modeling confinement and reversibility of threshold-dependent gene drive systems in spatially-explicit Aedes aegypti populations,"BackgroundThe discovery of CRISPR-based gene editing and its application to homing-based gene drive systems has been greeted with excitement, for its potential to control mosquito-borne diseases on a wide scale, and concern, for the invasiveness and potential irreversibility of a release. Gene drive systems that display threshold-dependent behavior could potentially be used during the trial phase of this technology, or when localized control is otherwise desired, as simple models predict them to spread into partially isolated populations in a confineable manner, and to be reversible through releases of wild-type organisms. Here, we model hypothetical releases of two recently-engineered threshold-dependent gene drive systems - reciprocal chromosomal translocations and a form of toxin-antidote-based underdominance known as UDMEL - to explore their ability to be confined and remediated.

ResultsWe simulate releases of Aedes aegypti, the mosquito vector of dengue, Zika and other arboviruses, in Yorkeys Knob, a suburb of Cairns, Australia, where previous biological control interventions have been undertaken on this species. We monitor spread to the neighboring suburb of Trinity Park to assess confinement. Results suggest that translocations could be introduced on a suburban scale, and remediated through releases of non-disease-transmitting male mosquitoes with release sizes on the scale of what has been previously implemented. UDMEL requires fewer releases to introduce, but more releases to remediate, including of females capable of disease transmission. Both systems are expected to be confineable to the release site; however, spillover of translocations into neighboring populations is less likely.

ConclusionsOur analysis supports the use of translocations as a threshold-dependent drive system capable of spreading disease-refractory genes into Ae. aegypti populations in a confineable and reversible manner. It also highlights increased release requirements when incorporating life history and population structure into models. As the technology nears implementation, further ecological work will be essential to enhance model predictions in preparation for field trials.",2020-01-21,ecology,Dengue,Dengue,backgroundthe discovery of crispr based gene editing and its application to homing based gene drive systems has been greeted with excitement for its potential to control mosquito borne diseases on a wide scale and concern for the invasiveness and potential irreversibility of a release gene drive systems that display threshold dependent behavior could potentially be used during the trial phase of this technology or when localized control is otherwise desired as simple models predict them to spread into partially isolated populations in a confineable manner and to be reversible through releases of wild type organisms here we model hypothetical releases of two recently engineered threshold dependent gene drive systems reciprocal chromosomal translocations and a form of toxin antidote based underdominance known as udmel to explore their ability to be confined and remediated resultswe simulate releases of aedes aegypti the mosquito vector of dengue zika and other arboviruses in yorkeys knob a suburb of cairns australia where previous biological control interventions have been undertaken on this species we monitor spread to the neighboring suburb of trinity park to assess confinement results suggest that translocations could be introduced on a suburban scale and remediated through releases of non disease transmitting male mosquitoes with release sizes on the scale of what has been previously implemented udmel requires fewer releases to introduce but more releases to remediate including of females capable of disease transmission both systems are expected to be confineable to the release site however spillover of translocations into neighboring populations is less likely conclusionsour analysis supports the use of translocations as a threshold dependent drive system capable of spreading disease refractory genes into ae aegypti populations in a confineable and reversible manner it also highlights increased release requirements when incorporating life history and population structure into models as the technology nears implementation further ecological work will be essential to enhance model predictions in preparation for field trials,backgroundthe discovery crispr base gene editing application home base gene drive system greet excitement potential control mosquito borne disease wide scale concern invasiveness potential irreversibility release gene drive system display threshold dependent behavior could potentially use trial phase technology localize control otherwise desire simple model predict spread partially isolate population confineable manner reversible release wild type organism model hypothetical release two recently engineer threshold dependent gene drive system reciprocal chromosomal translocation form toxin antidote base underdominance know udmel explore ability confine remediate resultswe simulate release aedes aegypti mosquito vector dengue zika arboviruse yorkey knob suburb cairn australia previous biological control intervention undertake species monitor spread neighboring suburb trinity park assess confinement result suggest translocation could introduce suburban scale remediate release non disease transmit male mosquito release size scale previously implement udmel require few release introduce release remediate include female capable disease transmission system expect confineable release site however spillover translocation neighboring population less likely conclusionsour analysis support use translocation threshold dependent drive system capable spread disease refractory gene aegypti population confineable reversible manner also highlight increase release requirement incorporate life history population structure model technology near implementation ecological work essential enhance model prediction preparation field trial
10.1101/2020.01.24.917971,Host-derived Circular RNAs Display Proviral Activities in Hepatitis C Virus - Infected Cells,"Viruses subvert macromolecular pathways in infected host cells to aid in viral gene amplification or to counteract innate immune responses. Roles for host-encoded RNAs, including microRNAs, have been found to provide pro- and anti-viral functions. Recently, circular RNAs (circRNAs), that are generated by a nuclear back-splicing mechanism of pre-mRNAs, have been implicated to have roles in DNA virus-infected cells. This study examines the circular RNA landscape in uninfected and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected liver cells. Results showed that the abundances of distinct classes of circRNAs were up-regulated or down-regulated in infected cells. Identified circRNAs displayed pro-viral effects. One particular up-regulated circRNA, circPSD3, displayed a very pronounced effect on viral RNA abundances in both hepatitis C virus- and Dengue virus-infected cells. Surprisingly, circPSD3 also inhibited the cellular nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway in liver cells. Thus, enhanced abundance of circPSD3 in virus-infected cells aids in viral replication and likely contributes to the known inhibition of NMD in HCV-infected cells. Findings from the global analyses of the circular RNA landscape argue pro-, and likely, anti-viral functions are executed by circRNAs that modulate both viral gene expression as well as host pathways. Because of their long half-lives, circRNAs likely play hitherto unknown, important roles in viral pathogenesis.

Author SummaryUsually, cells are infected by one or a few virus particles that carry genomes with limited expression capacity. Thus, the expression of viral genomes has to compete with a sea of cellular components that aid in viral translation, replication and virion production. Depending on their lifestyle, viruses have evolved to avoid or to subvert cellular pathways, especially those that display anti-viral functions. Host-derived circular RNA molecules have recently been discovered in the cytoplasm of cells, although, as-of yet, few functions have been assigned to them. Here, we describe alterations in the circular RNA landscape in hepatitis C virus-infected liver cells. Up-regulated and down-regulated circular RNAs were identified, and three of the upregulated RNAs were shown to promote HCV infection. One of them, circPSD3, inhibited the cellular nonsense-mediated RNA decay that is a powerful antiviral response in infected cells. Because circular RNAs are more stable than linear RNAs, they may have important functions during viral infection, dictating the outcomes of innate immune responses and viral pathogenesis.",2020-01-24,microbiology,Dengue,Dengue,viruses subvert macromolecular pathways in infected host cells to aid in viral gene amplification or to counteract innate immune responses roles for host encoded rnas including micrornas have been found to provide pro and anti viral functions recently circular rnas circrnas that are generated by a nuclear back splicing mechanism of pre mrnas have been implicated to have roles in dna virus infected cells this study examines the circular rna landscape in uninfected and hepatitis c virus hcv infected liver cells results showed that the abundances of distinct classes of circrnas were up regulated or down regulated in infected cells identified circrnas displayed pro viral effects one particular up regulated circrna circpsd displayed a very pronounced effect on viral rna abundances in both hepatitis c virus and dengue virus infected cells surprisingly circpsd also inhibited the cellular nonsense mediated decay nmd pathway in liver cells thus enhanced abundance of circpsd in virus infected cells aids in viral replication and likely contributes to the known inhibition of nmd in hcv infected cells findings from the global analyses of the circular rna landscape argue pro and likely anti viral functions are executed by circrnas that modulate both viral gene expression as well as host pathways because of their long half lives circrnas likely play hitherto unknown important roles in viral pathogenesis author summaryusually cells are infected by one or a few virus particles that carry genomes with limited expression capacity thus the expression of viral genomes has to compete with a sea of cellular components that aid in viral translation replication and virion production depending on their lifestyle viruses have evolved to avoid or to subvert cellular pathways especially those that display anti viral functions host derived circular rna molecules have recently been discovered in the cytoplasm of cells although as of yet few functions have been assigned to them here we describe alterations in the circular rna landscape in hepatitis c virus infected liver cells up regulated and down regulated circular rnas were identified and three of the upregulated rnas were shown to promote hcv infection one of them circpsd inhibited the cellular nonsense mediated rna decay that is a powerful antiviral response in infected cells because circular rnas are more stable than linear rnas they may have important functions during viral infection dictating the outcomes of innate immune responses and viral pathogenesis,virus subvert macromolecular pathway infect host cell aid viral gene amplification counteract innate immune response role host encode rna include microrna find provide pro anti viral function recently circular rnas circrnas generate nuclear back splicing mechanism pre mrnas implicate role dna virus infect cell study examine circular rna landscape uninfected hepatitis virus hcv infected liver cell result show abundance distinct class circrna regulate regulate infect cell identify circrna display pro viral effect one particular regulated circrna circpsd display pronounce effect viral rna abundance hepatitis virus dengue virus infect cell surprisingly circpsd also inhibit cellular nonsense mediate decay nmd pathway liver cell thus enhance abundance circpsd virus infect cell aid viral replication likely contribute know inhibition nmd hcv infected cell finding global analyse circular rna landscape argue pro likely anti viral function execute circrnas modulate viral gene expression well host pathway long half live circrnas likely play hitherto unknown important role viral pathogenesis author summaryusually cell infect one virus particle carry genome limited expression capacity thus expression viral genome compete sea cellular component aid viral translation replication virion production depend lifestyle virus evolve avoid subvert cellular pathway especially display anti viral function host derive circular rna molecule recently discover cytoplasm cell although yet function assign describe alteration circular rna landscape hepatitis virus infect liver cell regulate regulate circular rnas identify three upregulated rna show promote hcv infection one circpsd inhibit cellular nonsense mediate rna decay powerful antiviral response infect cell circular rnas stable linear rnas may important function viral infection dictate outcome innate immune response viral pathogenesis
10.1101/2020.08.31.276683,A versatile reporter system to monitor virus infected cells and its application to dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2,"Positive-strand RNA viruses have been the etiological agents in several major disease outbreaks over the last few decades. Examples of that are flaviviruses, such as dengue virus and Zika virus that cause millions of yearly infections and spread around the globe, and coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the current pandemic. The severity of outbreaks caused by these viruses stresses the importance of virology research in determining mechanisms to limit virus spread and to curb disease severity. Such studies require molecular tools to decipher virus-host interactions and to develop effective interventions. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of a reporter system to visualize dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2 replication in live cells. The system is based on viral protease activity causing cleavage and nuclear translocation of an engineered fluorescent protein that is expressed in the infected cells. We show the suitability of the system for live cell imaging and visualization of single infected cells as well as for screening and testing of antiviral compounds. Given the modular building blocks, the system is easy to manipulate and can be adapted to any virus encoding a protease, thus offering a high degree of flexibility.

IMPORTANCEReporter systems are useful tools for fast and quantitative visualization of viral replication and spread within a host cell population. Here we describe a reporter system that takes advantage of virus-encoded proteases that are expressed in infected cells to cleave an ER-anchored fluorescent protein fused to a nuclear localization sequence. Upon cleavage, the fluorescent protein translocates to the nucleus, allowing for rapid detection of the infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate reliable reporting activity for two major human pathogens from the Flaviviridae and the Coronaviridae families: dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2. We apply this reporter system to live cell imaging and use it for proof-of-concept to validate antiviral activity of a nucleoside analogue.

10.1101/2020.04.01.019976,Site-specific covalent labeling of large RNAs with nanoparticles empowered by expanded genetic alphabet transcription,"Conjugation of RNAs with nanoparticles is of significant importance for its numerous applications in biology and medicine, which however remains challenging, especially for large ones. So far, the majority of RNA labeling rely on solid-phase chemical synthesis, which is generally limited to RNAs smaller than 100 nts. We here present an efficient and generally applicable labeling strategy for site-specific covalent conjugation of large RNAs with gold nanoparticle (AuNP) empowered by expanded genetic alphabet transcription. We synthesize an amine-derivatized TPT3 (TPT3A), which are site-specifically incorporated into a 97-nt 3SL RNA and a 719-nt mini genomic RNA (DENV-mini) from Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) by standard in vitro transcription with expanded genetic alphabet containing the A-T, G-C natural base pairs and the TPT3-NaM unnatural base pair. TPT3 modification cause minimal structural perturbations to the RNAs by small angle X-ray scattering. The purified TPT3A-modified RNAs are covalently conjugated with mono-Sulfo-NHS-Nanogold nanoparticles via the highly selective amine-NHS ester reaction and purified under non-denaturing conditions. We demonstrate the application of the AuNP-RNA conjugates in large RNA structural biology by an emerging molecular ruler, X-ray scattering interferometry (XSI). The inter-nanoparticle distance distributions in the 3SL and DENV-mini RNAs derived from XSI measurements support the hypothetical model of flavivirus genome circularization, thus validate the applicability of this novel labeling strategy. The presented strategy overcomes the size constraints in conventional RNA labeling strategies, and is expected to have wide applications in large RNA structural biology and RNA nanotechnology.

Significance StatementWe present a site-specific labeling strategy for large RNAs by T7 transcription with expanded genetic alphabet containing TPT3-NaM unnatural base pair. The applicability of this labeling strategy is validated by X-ray scattering interferometry measurements on a 97-nt and a 719-nt RNAs. This strategy can be applicable to natural RNAs or artificial RNA nanostructures with sizes from tens up to thousands of nucleotides, or covalent conjugation of RNAs with other metal nanoparticles.

10.1101/2020.01.23.917757,Analysis of cell-associated DENV RNA by oligo(dT) primed 5' capture scRNAseq,"Dengue is one of the most widespread vector-borne viral diseases in the world. However, the size, heterogeneity, and temporal dynamics of the cell-associated viral reservoir during acute dengue virus (DENV) infection remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed cells infected in vitro with DENV and PBMC from an individual experiencing a natural DENV infection utilizing 5 capture single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). Both positive- and negative-sense DENV RNA was detected in reactions containing either an oligo(dT) primer alone, or in reactions supplemented with a DENV-specific primer. The addition of a DENV-specific primer did not increase the total amount of DENV RNA captured or the fraction of cells identified as containing DENV RNA. However, inclusion of a DENV-specific cDNA primer did increase the viral genome coverage immediately 5 to the primer binding site. Furthermore, while the majority of intracellular DENV sequence captured in this analysis mapped to the 5 end of the viral genome, distinct patterns of enhanced coverage within the DENV polyprotein coding region were observed. The 5 capture scRNAseq analysis of PBMC not only recapitulated previously published reports by detecting virally infected memory and naive B cells, but also identified cell-associated genomic variants not observed in contemporaneous serum samples. These results demonstrate that oligo(dT) primed 5 capture scRNAseq can detect DENV RNA and quantify virus-infected cells in physiologically relevant conditions, and provides insight into viral sequence variability within infected cells.

IMPORTANCEDengue is one of the most widespread vector-borne viral diseases in the world. However, it is still unclear which cells harbor virus during DENV infection, and how viral reservoirs in serum and infected cells are related. These results demonstrate for the first time that intracellular DENV RNA can be identified and infected cells quantified by 5 capture scRNAseq. This strategy provides a significantly greater throughput and higher sensitivity than previously published methods and has the potential to provide additional information on the genomic heterogeneity of intracellular DENV RNA.",2020-01-24,microbiology,Dengue,Dengue,dengue is one of the most widespread vector borne viral diseases in the world however the size heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of the cell associated viral reservoir during acute dengue virus denv infection remains unclear in this study we analyzed cells infected in vitro with denv and pbmc from an individual experiencing a natural denv infection utilizing capture single cell rna sequencing scrnaseq both positive and negative sense denv rna was detected in reactions containing either an oligo dt primer alone or in reactions supplemented with a denv specific primer the addition of a denv specific primer did not increase the total amount of denv rna captured or the fraction of cells identified as containing denv rna however inclusion of a denv specific cdna primer did increase the viral genome coverage immediately to the primer binding site furthermore while the majority of intracellular denv sequence captured in this analysis mapped to the end of the viral genome distinct patterns of enhanced coverage within the denv polyprotein coding region were observed the capture scrnaseq analysis of pbmc not only recapitulated previously published reports by detecting virally infected memory and naive b cells but also identified cell associated genomic variants not observed in contemporaneous serum samples these results demonstrate that oligo dt primed capture scrnaseq can detect denv rna and quantify virus infected cells in physiologically relevant conditions and provides insight into viral sequence variability within infected cells importancedengue is one of the most widespread vector borne viral diseases in the world however it is still unclear which cells harbor virus during denv infection and how viral reservoirs in serum and infected cells are related these results demonstrate for the first time that intracellular denv rna can be identified and infected cells quantified by capture scrnaseq this strategy provides a significantly greater throughput and higher sensitivity than previously published methods and has the potential to provide additional information on the genomic heterogeneity of intracellular denv rna,dengue one widespread vector bear viral disease world however size heterogeneity temporal dynamic cell associate viral reservoir acute dengue virus denv infection remain unclear study analyze cell infect vitro denv pbmc individual experience natural denv infection utilize capture single cell rna sequence scrnaseq positive negative sense denv rna detect reaction contain either oligo primer alone reaction supplement denv specific primer addition denv specific primer increase total amount denv rna capture fraction cell identify contain denv rna however inclusion denv specific cdna primer increase viral genome coverage immediately primer bind site furthermore majority intracellular denv sequence capture analysis map end viral genome distinct pattern enhance coverage within denv polyprotein code region observe capture scrnaseq analysis pbmc recapitulate previously publish report detect virally infect memory naive cell also identify cell associate genomic variant observe contemporaneous serum sample result demonstrate oligo prime capture scrnaseq detect denv rna quantify virus infect cell physiologically relevant condition provide insight viral sequence variability within infected cell importancedengue one widespread vector bear viral disease world however still unclear cell harbor virus denv infection viral reservoir serum infect cell relate result demonstrate first time intracellular denv rna identify infected cell quantify capture scrnaseq strategy provide significantly great throughput high sensitivity previously publish method potential provide additional information genomic heterogeneity intracellular denv rna
10.1101/2020.09.18.303149,Cocculus hirsutus -derived phytopharmaceutical drug has potent anti-dengue activity,"BackgroundDengue is a serious public health concern worldwide, with ~3 billion people at risk of contracting dengue virus (DENV) infections. Currently, no effective vaccine or drug is available for the prevention or treatment of dengue, which leaves only anti-mosquito strategies to combat this disease. The present study was initiated to determine the in-vitro and in vivo protective effects of a plant-derived phytopharmaceutical drug for the treatment of dengue.

Methodology/Principal FindingsIn our previous report, we had identified methanolic extract of the aerial parts of Cissampelos pareira to exhibit in vitro and in vivo anti-dengue activity against all the four DENV serotypes. In the current study, we have identified another Indian medicinal plant, Cocculus hirsutus, which has a more potent anti-dengue activity than C. pareira. The activity has been evaluated through flow-cytometry-based virus inhibition assay. Interestingly, the stem of C. hirsutus was found to be more potent than the aerial part irrespective of the extraction solvent used viz., denatured spirit, hydro-alcohol (50:50) and water. Hence, the aqueous extract of stem of C. hirsutus (AQCH) was further advanced for investigations because of greater regulatory acceptance. The AQCH exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of release of DENV and its secretory antigen, NS1. Five chemical markers viz. Sinococuline, 20-Hydroxyecdysone, Makisterone-A, Magnoflorine and Coniferyl alcohol were identified as the major chemical ingredients of the AQCH extract. These chemicals were subsequently used for extract standardisation. Importantly, AQCH completely protected AG129 mice at 25 mg/kg/dose body weight when fed 4 times a day post-infection with a lethal dose of DENV-2 S221 strain. Because of its potential as an effective phytopharmaceutical drug against dengue, AQCH, has been formulated into tablets for further pre-clinical and clinical developments.

Conclusions/SignificanceWe provide evidence of the pan anti-dengue potential of C. hirsutus-based phytopharmaceutical drug as determined through in vitro and in vivo experiments. We have also characterized five chemical entities in the drug substance, which provides means for standardization of drug substance and drug product. Based on these findings, a program to develop a safe and effective C. hirsutus-derived phytopharmaceutical drug for the treatment of dengue has been initiated.

Author summaryThere is an urgent need to develop a safe and effective drug against dengue, which is a rapidly expanding mosquito-borne viral disease. Half of the worlds population has been estimated to be at risk of contracting this disease and the situation remains grim due to lack of an approved drug. We aimed to develop an ethnopharmacological drug against dengue by exploring traditional Indian medicinal science, Ayurveda. This led us to identify a creeper, Cocculus hirsutus, as a more potent anti-dengue plant than Cissampelos pareira, reported in our earlier published study. The stem part of C. hirsutus was found to be more efficacious in inhibiting the propagation of dengue viruses (DENVs) in cell culture than its aerial part. Hence, we chose to advance aqueous extract of stem of C. hirsutus (AQCH) for further studies. Importantly, AQCH also protected immune-compromised mice from lethal DENV infection, which is suggestive of its potential clinical relevance. We have identified five chemical marker compounds in AQCH to gauge the quality and consistency of extract preparation and its formulation into stable tablets.

Furthermore, the virus susceptibility studies revealed that DENV-2 could propagate in D. melanogaster, and DENV-2 produced in fruit fly is equally infectious to D. melanogaster and Ae. aegypti. Additionally, real time PCR analysis revealed that RNAi coupled with JAK-STAT and Toll pathway constitutes an effector mechanism to control the DENV-2 infection in flies.

10.1101/2020.10.19.345603,Vectorchip: Microfluidic platform for highly parallel bite by bite profiling of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission,"Mosquito bites transmit a number of human pathogens resulting in potentially fatal diseases including malaria, dengue, chikungunya, West Nile encephalitis, and Zika. Although female mosquitoes transmit pathogens via salivary droplets deposited during blood feeding on a host, very little is known about the genomic content of these nanoliter scale droplets, including the transmission dynamics of live pathogens. Here we introduce Vectorchip, a low-cost, scalable microfluidic platform for molecular interrogation of individual mosquito bites in a high-throughput fashion. An ultra-thin PDMS membrane coupled to a microfluidic chip acts as a biting interface, through which freely-behaving mosquitoes deposit saliva droplets by biting into isolated arrayed micro-wells enabling molecular interrogation of individual bites. By modulating membrane thickness, the device enables on-chip comparison of biting capacity and provides a mechanical filter allowing selection of a specific mosquito species. Utilizing Vectorchip, we show on-chip simultaneous detection of mosquito DNA as well as viral RNA from Zika infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes - demonstrating multiplexed high-throughput screening of vectors and pathogens. Focus-forming assays performed on-chip quantify number of infectious viral particles transmitted during mosquito bites, enabling assessment of active virus transmission.

Here for the first time, by NMR and molecular docking, we reveal that Curcumin allosterically inhibits the Dengue protease by binding to a cavity with no overlap with the active site. Further molecular dynamics (MD) simulations decode that the binding of Curcumin leads to unfolding/displacing the characteristic {beta}-hairpin of the C-terminal NS2B and consequently disrupting the closed (active) conformation of the protease. Our study identified a cavity most likely conserved in all flaviviral NS2B-NS3 proteases, which could thus serve as a therapeutic target for discovery/design of small molecule allosteric inhibitors.

10.1101/2020.04.21.047241,"Antigenicity, stability, and reproducibility of Zika reporter virus particles for long-term applications","The development of vaccines against flaviviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV), continues to be a major challenge, hindered by the lack of efficient and reliable methods for screening neutralizing activity of sera or antibodies. To address this need, we previously developed a plasmid-based, replication-incompetent DENV reporter virus particle (RVP) production system as an efficient and safe alternative to the Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT). As part of the response to the 2015-2016 ZIKV outbreak, we recently developed pseudo-infectious ZIKV RVPs by modifying our DENV RVP system. The use of ZIKV RVPs as critical reagents in human clinical trials requires their further validation using stability and reproducibility metrics for large-scale applications. In the current study, we validated ZIKV RVPs using infectivity, neutralization, and enhancement assays with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and human ZIKV-positive patient serum. ZIKV RVPs are antigenically identical to live virus based on binding ELISA and neutralization results and are nonreplicating based on the results of plaque formation assays. We demonstrate reproducible neutralization titer data (NT50 values) across different RVP production lots, volumes, time frames, and laboratories. We also show RVP stability across experimentally relevant time intervals and temperatures. Our results demonstrate that ZIKV RVPs provide a safe, rapid, and reproducible reagent for large-scale, long-term studies of neutralizing antibodies and sera, which can facilitate large-scale screening and epidemiological studies to help expedite ZIKV vaccine development.

Large outbreaks of ZIKV occurred in 2015 and 2016 and there are still no drugs or vaccines available to protect against ZIKV infection. Vaccine development has been hindered by the lack of safe and efficient methods to screen ZIKV neutralizing properties of patient sera or antibodies, especially in the context of large clinical trials. To address this unmet need, we developed and validated the use of ZIKV reporter virus particles (RVPs), a safe, high-throughput and quantitative alternative to using live virus for neutralization studies.

10.1101/2020.01.14.906297,Machine learning and dengue forecasting: Comparing random forests and artificial neural networks for predicting dengue burdens at the national sub-national scale in Colombia,"The robust estimate and forecast capability of random forests (RF) has been widely recognized, however this ensemble machine learning method has not been widely used in mosquito-borne disease forecasting. In this study, two sets of RF models were developed for the national and departmental levels in Colombia to predict weekly dengue cases at 12-weeks ahead. A national model based on artificial neural networks (ANN) was also developed and used as a comparator to the RF models. The various predictors included historic dengue cases, satellite-derived estimates for vegetation, precipitation, and air temperature, population counts, income inequality, and education. Our RF model trained on the national data was more accurate for department-specific weekly dengue cases estimation compared to a local model trained only on the departments data. Additionally, the forecast errors of the national RF model were smaller to those of the national ANN model and were increased with the forecast horizon increasing from one-week ahead (mean absolute error, MAE: 5.80; root mean squared error, RMSE: 11.10) to 12-weeks ahead (MAE: 13.38; RMSE: 26.82). There was considerable variation in the relative importance of predictors dependent on forecast horizon. The environmental and meteorological predictors were relatively important for short-term dengue forecast horizons while socio-demographic predictors were relevant for longer-term forecast horizons. This study showed the potential of RF in dengue forecasting with also demonstrating the feasibility of using a national model to forecast at finer spatial scales. Furthermore, sociodemographic predictors are important to include to capture longer-term trends in dengue.

Author summaryDengue virus has the highest disease burden of all mosquito-borne viral diseases, infecting 390 million people annually in 128 countries. Forecasting is an important warning mechanism that can help with proactive planning and response for clinical and public health services. In this study, we compare two different machine learning approaches to dengue forecasting: random forest (RF) and neural networks (NN). National and local (departmental-level) models were compared and used to predict dengue cases in the future. The results showed that the counts of future dengue cases were more accurately estimated by RF than by NN.

10.1101/2020.04.06.027706,Characterization of essential eggshell proteins from Aedes aegypti mosquitoes,"Up to 40% of the world population now live in areas where dengue mosquito vectors coexist with humans. Aedes aegypti are vectors for zoonotic diseases that affect hundreds of millions of individuals per year globally. We recently identified the eggshell organizing factor 1 (EOF1) protein using systematic RNA interference (RNAi) screening of mosquito lineage-specific genes. It was shown that eggs deposited by RNAi-EOF1 A. aegypti and A. albopictus mosquitoes were non-melanized, fragile, and contained nonviable embryos. Motivated by this discovery, we performed RNAi screening of eggshell proteins to determine putative downstream target proteins of intracellular EOF1. We identified several eggshell proteins as essential for eggshell formation in A. aegypti and characterized their phenotypes in detail by molecular and biochemical approaches. We found that Nasrat, Closca, and Polehole structural proteins, together with the Nudel serine protease, are indispensable for eggshell melanization and egg viability. While all four proteins are predominantly expressed in ovaries of adult females, Nudel mRNA expression is highly upregulated in response to blood feeding. Furthermore, we identified four secreted eggshell enzymes as important factors for controlling the processes of mosquito eggshell formation and melanization. These enzymes included three dopachrome converting enzymes and one cysteine protease. All eight characterized eggshell proteins were required for intact eggshell formation. However, their surface topologies in response to RNAi did not phenocopy the effect of RNAi-EOF1. Still, it remains unclear how EOF1 influences eggshell formation and melanization. The use of proteomic analysis of eggshell proteins from RNAi-EOF1 assisted in the identification of additional proteins that could be regulated in EOF1 deficient eggshells.",2020-04-07,developmental biology,Dengue,Dengue,up to of the world population now live in areas where dengue mosquito vectors coexist with humans aedes aegypti are vectors for zoonotic diseases that affect hundreds of millions of individuals per year globally we recently identified the eggshell organizing factor eof protein using systematic rna interference rnai screening of mosquito lineage specific genes it was shown that eggs deposited by rnai eof a aegypti and a albopictus mosquitoes were non melanized fragile and contained nonviable embryos motivated by this discovery we performed rnai screening of eggshell proteins to determine putative downstream target proteins of intracellular eof we identified several eggshell proteins as essential for eggshell formation in a aegypti and characterized their phenotypes in detail by molecular and biochemical approaches we found that nasrat closca and polehole structural proteins together with the nudel serine protease are indispensable for eggshell melanization and egg viability while all four proteins are predominantly expressed in ovaries of adult females nudel mrna expression is highly upregulated in response to blood feeding furthermore we identified four secreted eggshell enzymes as important factors for controlling the processes of mosquito eggshell formation and melanization these enzymes included three dopachrome converting enzymes and one cysteine protease all eight characterized eggshell proteins were required for intact eggshell formation however their surface topologies in response to rnai did not phenocopy the effect of rnai eof still it remains unclear how eof influences eggshell formation and melanization the use of proteomic analysis of eggshell proteins from rnai eof assisted in the identification of additional proteins that could be regulated in eof deficient eggshells,world population live area dengue mosquito vector coexist human aede aegypti vector zoonotic disease affect hundred million individual per year globally recently identify eggshell organizing factor eof protein use systematic rna interference rnai screening mosquito lineage specific gene show egg deposit rnai eof aegypti albopictus mosquito non melanize fragile contain nonviable embryo motivated discovery perform rnai screen eggshell protein determine putative downstream target protein intracellular eof identify several eggshell protein essential eggshell formation aegypti characterize phenotypes detail molecular biochemical approach find nasrat closca polehole structural protein together nudel serine protease indispensable eggshell melanization egg viability four protein predominantly express ovary adult female nudel mrna expression highly upregulated response blood feeding furthermore identify four secrete eggshell enzyme important factor control process mosquito eggshell formation melanization enzyme include three dopachrome converting enzyme one cysteine protease eight characterized eggshell protein require intact eggshell formation however surface topology response rnai phenocopy effect rnai eof still remain unclear eof influence eggshell formation melanization use proteomic analysis eggshell protein rnai eof assist identification additional protein could regulate eof deficient eggshell
10.1101/2020.04.04.025163,A benzene-mapping approach for uncovering cryptic pockets in membrane-bound proteins,"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in combination with small organic probes present in the solvent have previously been used as a method to reveal cryptic pockets that may not have been identified in experimental structures. We report such a method implemented within the CHARMM forcefield to effectively explore cryptic pockets on the surfaces of membrane-embedded proteins using benzene as a probe molecule. This relies on modified non-bonded parameters in addition to repulsive potentials between membrane lipids and benzene molecules. The method was tested on part of the outer shell of the dengue virus (DENV), for which research into a safe and effective neutralizing antibody or drug molecule is still ongoing. In particular, the envelope (E) protein, associated with the membrane (M) protein, is a lipid membrane-embedded complex which forms a dimer in the mature viral envelope. Solvent mapping was performed for the full, membrane-embedded EM protein complex and compared with similar calculations performed for the isolated, soluble E protein ectodomain dimer in solvent. Ectodomain-only simulations with benzene exhibited unfolding effects not observed in the more physiologically relevant membrane-associated systems. A cryptic pocket which has been experimentally shown to bind n-octyl-{beta}-D-glucoside detergent was consistently revealed in all benzene-containing simulations. The addition of benzene also enhanced the flexibility and hydrophobic exposure of cryptic pockets at a key, functional interface in the E protein, and revealed a novel, potentially druggable pocket that may be targeted to prevent conformational changes associated with viral entry into the cell.

10.1101/2020.09.14.295915,Fusion and fission events regulate endosome maturation and viral escape,"Many intra-cellular processes rely on transport by endosomes. Recent experimental techniques have provided insights into organelle maturation and its specific role in, for instance, the ability of a virus to escape an endosome and release its genetic material in the cytoplasm. Endosome maturation and dynamics depend on GTPases called Rabs, found on their membrane. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework, combining coagulation and fragmentation of endosomes with two variables internal to each organelle, to model endosomes as intra-cellular compartments characterised by their levels of (active) Rab5 and Rab7. The key element in our framework is the ""per-cell endosomal distribution"" and its its dynamical equation or Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann equation, then, allows one to deduce simple equations for the total number of endosomes in a cell, and for the mean and standard deviation of the Rab5 and Rab7 levels. We compare our solutions with experimental data sets of Dengue viral escape from endosomes. The relationship between endosomal Rab levels and pH suggests a mechanism which can account for the observed variability in viral escape times, which in turn regulate the viability of a viral intra-cellular infection.

Author summaryEndosomes are intra-cellular receptacle-like organelles, which transport endocytosed cargo upon internalisation from the plasma membrane. These early endosomes, also known as sorting endosomes, mature to late endosomes, with a lower pH than early ones, as a consequence of the intricate dynamics of a family of molecules called Rabs. Viruses exploit this endosomal pH drop to their advantage. Here we bring together experimental data on Dengue viral escape times from endosomes and a novel mathematical framework inspired by the theory of droplet coalescence, to improve our understanding of endosome maturation, and in turn to quantify the large variability of viral escape times. This mathematical framework can easily be generalised to model the dynamics of other intra-cellular organelles, such as mitochondria or the endoplasmic reticulum.",2020-09-14,systems biology,Dengue,Dengue,many intra cellular processes rely on transport by endosomes recent experimental techniques have provided insights into organelle maturation and its specific role in for instance the ability of a virus to escape an endosome and release its genetic material in the cytoplasm endosome maturation and dynamics depend on gtpases called rabs found on their membrane here we introduce a mathematical framework combining coagulation and fragmentation of endosomes with two variables internal to each organelle to model endosomes as intra cellular compartments characterised by their levels of active rab and rab the key element in our framework is the per cell endosomal distribution and its its dynamical equation or boltzmann equation the boltzmann equation then allows one to deduce simple equations for the total number of endosomes in a cell and for the mean and standard deviation of the rab and rab levels we compare our solutions with experimental data sets of dengue viral escape from endosomes the relationship between endosomal rab levels and ph suggests a mechanism which can account for the observed variability in viral escape times which in turn regulate the viability of a viral intra cellular infection author summaryendosomes are intra cellular receptacle like organelles which transport endocytosed cargo upon internalisation from the plasma membrane these early endosomes also known as sorting endosomes mature to late endosomes with a lower ph than early ones as a consequence of the intricate dynamics of a family of molecules called rabs viruses exploit this endosomal ph drop to their advantage here we bring together experimental data on dengue viral escape times from endosomes and a novel mathematical framework inspired by the theory of droplet coalescence to improve our understanding of endosome maturation and in turn to quantify the large variability of viral escape times this mathematical framework can easily be generalised to model the dynamics of other intra cellular organelles such as mitochondria or the endoplasmic reticulum,many intra cellular process rely transport endosome recent experimental technique provide insight organelle maturation specific role instance ability virus escape endosome release genetic material cytoplasm endosome maturation dynamic depend gtpase call rab find membrane introduce mathematical framework combine coagulation fragmentation endosome two variable internal organelle model endosomes intra cellular compartment characterise level active rab rab key element framework per cell endosomal distribution dynamical equation boltzmann equation boltzmann equation allow one deduce simple equation total number endosome cell mean standard deviation rab rab level compare solution experimental datum set dengue viral escape endosome relationship endosomal rab level suggest mechanism account observe variability viral escape time turn regulate viability viral intra cellular infection author summaryendosome intra cellular receptacle like organelle transport endocytose cargo upon internalisation plasma membrane early endosome also know sort endosome mature late endosome low early one consequence intricate dynamic family molecule call rab virus exploit endosomal drop advantage bring together experimental datum dengue viral escape time endosome novel mathematical framework inspire theory droplet coalescence improve understand endosome maturation turn quantify large variability viral escape time mathematical framework easily generalise model dynamic intra cellular organelle mitochondria endoplasmic reticulum

However, there is a dearth of knowledge on SG immunity. Here, we characterized SG immune response to dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses using high-throughput transcriptomics. The three viruses regulate components of Toll, IMD and JNK pathways. However, silencing of Toll and IMD components showed variable effects on SG infection by each virus. In contrast, regulation of JNK pathway produced consistent responses. Virus infection increased with depletion of component Kayak and decreased with depletion of negative regulator Puckered. Virus-induced JNK pathway regulates complement and apoptosis in SGs via TEP20 and Dronc, respectively. Individual and co-silencing of these genes demonstrate their antiviral effects and that both may function together.

10.1101/768549,Heterogeneous genetic invasions of three insecticide resistance mutations in Indo-Pacific populations of Aedes aegypti (L.),"Nations throughout the Indo-Pacific region use pyrethroid insecticides to control Aedes aegypti, the mosquito vector of dengue, often without knowledge of pyrethroid resistance status of the pest or origin of resistance. Two mutations (V1016G + F1534C) in the sodium channel gene (Vssc) of Ae. aegypti modify ion channel function and cause target-site resistance to pyrethroid insecticides, with a third mutation (S989P) having a potential additive effect. Of 27 possible genotypes involving these mutations, some allelic combinations are never seen while others predominate. Here, five allelic combinations common in Ae. aegypti from the Indo-Pacific region are described and their geographical distributions investigated using genome-wide SNP markers. We tested the hypothesis that resistance allele combinations evolved de novo in populations, versus the alternative that dispersal of Ae. aegypti between populations facilitated genetic invasions of allele combinations. We used latent factor mixed-models to detect SNPs throughout the genome that showed structuring in line with resistance allele combinations and compared variation at SNPs within the Vssc gene with genome-wide variation. Mixed-models detected an array of SNPs linked to resistance allele combinations, all located within or in close proximity to the Vssc gene. Variation at SNPs within the Vssc gene was structured by resistance profile, while genome-wide SNPs were structured by population. These results demonstrate that alleles near to resistance mutations have been transferred between populations via linked selection. This indicates that genetic invasions have contributed to the widespread occurrence of Vssc allele combinations in Ae. aegypti in the Indo-Pacific region, pointing to undocumented mosquito invasions between countries.",2020-03-18,evolutionary biology,Dengue,Dengue,nations throughout the indo pacific region use pyrethroid insecticides to control aedes aegypti the mosquito vector of dengue often without knowledge of pyrethroid resistance status of the pest or origin of resistance two mutations v g f c in the sodium channel gene vssc of ae aegypti modify ion channel function and cause target site resistance to pyrethroid insecticides with a third mutation s p having a potential additive effect of possible genotypes involving these mutations some allelic combinations are never seen while others predominate here five allelic combinations common in ae aegypti from the indo pacific region are described and their geographical distributions investigated using genome wide snp markers we tested the hypothesis that resistance allele combinations evolved de novo in populations versus the alternative that dispersal of ae aegypti between populations facilitated genetic invasions of allele combinations we used latent factor mixed models to detect snps throughout the genome that showed structuring in line with resistance allele combinations and compared variation at snps within the vssc gene with genome wide variation mixed models detected an array of snps linked to resistance allele combinations all located within or in close proximity to the vssc gene variation at snps within the vssc gene was structured by resistance profile while genome wide snps were structured by population these results demonstrate that alleles near to resistance mutations have been transferred between populations via linked selection this indicates that genetic invasions have contributed to the widespread occurrence of vssc allele combinations in ae aegypti in the indo pacific region pointing to undocumented mosquito invasions between countries,nation throughout indo pacific region use pyrethroid insecticide control aedes aegypti mosquito vector dengue often without knowledge pyrethroid resistance status pest origin resistance two mutation sodium channel gene vssc aegypti modify ion channel function cause target site resistance pyrethroid insecticide third mutation potential additive effect possible genotype involve mutation allelic combination never see other predominate five allelic combination common aegypti indo pacific region describe geographical distribution investigate use genome wide snp marker test hypothesis resistance allele combination evolve novo population versus alternative dispersal aegypti population facilitate genetic invasion allele combination use latent factor mixed model detect snps throughout genome show structure line resistance allele combination compare variation snps within vssc gene genome wide variation mixed model detect array snps link resistance allele combination locate within close proximity vssc gene variation snps within vssc gene structure resistance profile genome wide snps structure population result demonstrate allele near resistance mutation transfer population via link selection indicate genetic invasion contribute widespread occurrence vssc allele combinations aegypti indo pacific region point undocumented mosquito invasion country
10.1101/2020.05.13.094136,DENV NS1 and MMP-9 cooperate to induce vascular leakage by altering endothelial cell adhesion and tight junction,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that causes a spectrum of diseases including life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Vascular leakage is a common clinical crisis in DHF/DSS patients which is closely associated with increased endothelial permeability. The presence of vascular leakage causes hypotension, circulatory failure or disseminated intravascular coagulation as the disease progresses, which can lead to death under such conditions. However, the mechanisms by which DENV infection caused the vascular leakage are not fully understood. This study reveals a distinct mechanism by which DENV induces endothelial permeability and vascular leakage in human endothelial cells and mice tissues. We initially show that DENV2 promotes the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression and secretion in DHF patient serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophages, and further reveal that DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) induces MMP-9 expression through activating the nuclear factor {kappa}B (NF-{kappa}B) signaling pathway. Additionally, NS1 inhibits TIMP-1 expression to facilitates the MMP-9 enzymatic activity which alters the adhesion and tight junctions and vascular leakage in human endothelial cells and mouse tissues. Moreover, NS1 recruits MMP-9 to interact with {beta}-catenin and Zona occludins protein-1/2 to degrade the important adhesion and tight junction proteins, thereby inducing endothelial hyperpermeability and vascular leakage in human endothelial cells and mouse tissues. Thus, we reveal that DENV NS1 and MMP-9 cooperatively induce vascular leakage by impairing endothelial cell adhesion and tight junction, and suggest that MMP-9 may serve as a potential target for the treatment of hypovolemia in DSS/DHF patients.

Author SummaryDENV is the most common mosquito-transmitted viral pathogen in humans. In general, DENV-infected patients are either asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms with fever and rash. However, in severe cases of DENV infection, the disease may progress to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS), the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in school-age children in tropical and subtropical regions. DENV-induced vascular leakage is characterized by enhanced vascular permeability without morphological damage to the capillary endothelium. We found that a distinct mechanism of DENV NS1 and MMP-9 cooperatively induce vascular leakage is the main reason leading to death in severe dengue patients. Also, NS1 recruits MMP-9 to degrade {beta}-catenin, ZO-1, ZO-2 to intervene endothelial hyperpermeability in human endothelial cells and mouse vascular. Finally, we reveal that DENV activating NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway induces MMP-9 expression, in patients, mice, PBMC and macrophages though the viral NS1 protein. This study would provide new in signs into the pathogenesis caused by DENV infection, and suggest that MMP-9 may acts as a drug target for the prevention and treatment of DENV-associated

In infected cells, flaviviruses first assemble into an immature form within the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), and then undergo further processing by furin protease in the trans-Golgi. Despite substantial efforts, previous cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies of immature flaviviruses were restricted to low to medium resolutions, limiting our understanding of maturation. To better grasp the process of maturation, we have carried out cryo-EM reconstructions of immature Spondweni virus (SPOV), an emerging human flavivirus belonging to the same serogroup as ZIKV (~75% amino acid identity). By combining localized reconstruction and focused refinement, we were able to improve the resolution to 3.8 [A], yielding unprecedented insight into the immature form. The structure elucidates how, at neutral pH, polar interactions conceal the furin recognition site within trimeric envelope (E) protein spikes. Furthermore, we identify how a strictly conserved pH sensor anchors the precursor membrane (prM) protein to immature E. We reconstructed mature forms of SPONV and DENV to 2.6[A] and 3.1[A], respectively. Comparison with immature virus shows a conserved binding pocket for a lipid headgroup, which forms as a consequence of the rearrangement of amphipathic stem-helices of E. We propose a structural role for the pocket and suggest it stabilizes mature E. Taken together, our data suggest a compelling rationale for low-pH triggered conformational rearrangement in the Golgi, which occurs during flavivirus maturation.",2020-06-07,microbiology,Dengue,Dengue,mosquito transmitted flaviviruses such as dengue virus denv or zika virus zikv are responsible for significant economic damage and human misery in infected cells flaviviruses first assemble into an immature form within the endoplasmatic reticulum er and then undergo further processing by furin protease in the trans golgi despite substantial efforts previous cryogenic electron microscopy cryo em studies of immature flaviviruses were restricted to low to medium resolutions limiting our understanding of maturation to better grasp the process of maturation we have carried out cryo em reconstructions of immature spondweni virus spov an emerging human flavivirus belonging to the same serogroup as zikv amino acid identity by combining localized reconstruction and focused refinement we were able to improve the resolution to a yielding unprecedented insight into the immature form the structure elucidates how at neutral ph polar interactions conceal the furin recognition site within trimeric envelope e protein spikes furthermore we identify how a strictly conserved ph sensor anchors the precursor membrane prm protein to immature e we reconstructed mature forms of sponv and denv to a and a respectively comparison with immature virus shows a conserved binding pocket for a lipid headgroup which forms as a consequence of the rearrangement of amphipathic stem helices of e we propose a structural role for the pocket and suggest it stabilizes mature e taken together our data suggest a compelling rationale for low ph triggered conformational rearrangement in the golgi which occurs during flavivirus maturation,mosquito transmit flavivirus dengue virus denv zika virus zikv responsible significant economic damage human misery infect cell flaviviruse first assemble immature form within endoplasmatic reticulum undergo processing furin protease trans golgi despite substantial effort previous cryogenic electron microscopy cryo study immature flavivirus restrict low medium resolution limit understand maturation well grasp process maturation carry cryo reconstruction immature spondweni virus spov emerge human flavivirus belong serogroup zikv amino acid identity combine localize reconstruction focus refinement able improve resolution yield unprecedented insight immature form structure elucidate neutral polar interaction conceal furin recognition site within trimeric envelope protein spike furthermore identify strictly conserve sensor anchor precursor membrane prm protein immature reconstruct mature form sponv denv respectively comparison immature virus show conserve bind pocket lipid headgroup form consequence rearrangement amphipathic stem helix propose structural role pocket suggest stabilize mature take together datum suggest compelling rationale low trigger conformational rearrangement golgi occur flavivirus maturation

Chikungunya and Rift Valley Fever outbreaks have also been recorded in the past decade. Little is known on the burden of the arboviral disease causing viruses (Dengue, Rift Valley and Chikungunya) endemically in the inter-epidemic periods. We aimed at determining the prevalence of the dengue, rift valley and chikungunya among humans in two geo ecologically distinct sites.

MethodologyThe community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Magugu in Manyara region and Mvomero in Morogoro region in Tanzania. Venous blood was collected from participants of all age groups, serum prepared from samples and subjected to ELISA tests for RVFV IgG/IgM, DENV IgG/IgM, and CHIKV IgM/IgG. Samples that were positive for IgM ELISA tests were subjected to a quantitative RT PCR for each virus. A structured questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic information. Data analysis was conducted using SPSSv22.

ResultsA total of 191 individuals from both sites participated in the study. Only one CHIKV was detected in Magugu site but none of the 69 participants from Magugu site was seropositive or positive for RVFV and DENV. Of the 122 individuals from Wami-Dakawa site, 16.39% (n=20) had recent exposure to RVFV while 9.83% (n=12) were recently infected by Chikungunya virus. All samples were negative by RVFV and CHIKV qPCR. Neither Infection nor exposure to DENV was observed in participants from Wami-Dakawa. Risk factors associated with RVFV and DCHIKV seropositivity were being more than 5 in a household, having no formal education and having recently travelled to an urban area.

ConclusionWe report an active circulation of RVFV and CHIKV in humans in Wami-Dakawa, in Mvomero district of Morogoro region during dry season, a higher rate of exposure to RVFV compared to CHIKV and an absence of circulating RVFV, DENV and CHIKV in humans in Magugu site in Manyara region.

Author SummaryDengue, Chikungunya, rift valley and other viruses constitute an important group of etiologies of fever in Tanzania. In the past decade, Tanzania has experienced DENV and RVFV at different times. While RVFV outbreaks have occurred cyclically in approximately ten-year periods in Tanzania, DENV outbreaks have been more frequent since 2010. CHIKV infection is an important but largely unrecognized illness in Tanzania. In this study, we aimed to generate baseline data on the exposure and infection status of DENV, RVFV and CHIKV by detecting antibodies to the viruses and detecting the viruses in human subjects in two geo-ecological distinct sites. Neither infection nor exposure to the viruses were in observed in Magugu site in Manyara region, northern Tanzania. There was a significant exposure to RVFV (16.39%) and CHIKV (9.83%) in Wami-Dakawa but not to DENV in either site. None of the viruses was detected by PCR in any of the sites. Potential risks for exposure to CHIKV and RVFV were Larger numbers of household members, having no formal education and having recently travelled to an urban destination.

The intensive application of insecticides in orchards could impact not only agricultural insect pests, but also non-target insects, such as mosquitoes, or non-target beneficial insects. In this study, the population density and insecticide susceptibility of Aedes albopictus populations to field application concentrations of four agrochemical insecticides - cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos, carbaryl, and imidacloprid were examined. Mosquito eggs were collected from durian cultivation sites in five provinces in southern Thailand and hatched and allowed to develop to the adult stage. The study sites were categorized into three groups based on insecticide application; intensive-application of insecticides (IA), less-application of insecticides (LA), and no application of insecticides (NA). Twenty ovitraps were deployed for at least three consecutive days at each study site to collect mosquito eggs and to determine the Ae. albopictus population density then WHO tube assays being used to determine the susceptibility of adult mosquitoes to selected insecticides. This study represents the first report of the agrochemical insecticide susceptibility status of Ae. albopictus collected from durian orchards in southern Thailand. The study found that the populations of Ae. albopictus were susceptible to chlorpyrifos, but showed reduced mortality following exposure to lambda-cyhalothrin, carbaryl, and imidacloprid which is suggestive of the existence of resistance.

Therefore, the efficacy of an autodissemination approach in small-scale field trials against wild Aedes sp. population was evaluated in an urbanized setting, Malaysia. Lethal ovitraps enhanced with pyriproxyfen were used to control Aedes sp. populations at treatment sites, with the autodissemination activity was assessed using the WHO larval bioassays. Lethal ovitraps enhanced with pyriproxyfen effectively reduced of Aedes sp. population. All autodissemination stations were shown to be visited by Aedes sp. mosquitoes with 100% complete inhibition against eggs and larvae development. In the larvae bioassay, pupae mortality ranged from 14 to 40%. Statistically, a significant reduction of Aedes sp. population in the treatment sites compared to the untreated areas. The study proved for the autodissemination of pyriproxyfen to breeding habitats by wild Aedes sp. This technique is highly potentially for vector control activities. Future evaluation should focus on large-scale field trials.

Methods such as the sterile and incompatible insect techniques (SIT/IIT) rely on modified males to seek out and successfully mate with females, and in doing so outcompete the wild male population for mates. Currently, these interventions infer the success of mating interactions between male and female insects through area-wide population surveillance and observations of mating competitiveness are rare. Furthermore, little is known about male Ae. aegypti behaviours and biology in field settings. In preparation for a large, community scale IIT program, we undertook a series of mark-release-recapture experiments using rhodamine B to mark male Ae. aegypti sperm and measure mating interactions with females. We also developed the Spatial and Temporally Evolving Isotropic Kernel (STEIK) framework to assist researchers to estimate the movement of individuals through space and time. Results showed that ~40% of daily females captured were unmated, suggesting interventions will need to release males regularly to be effective at suppressing Ae. aegypti populations. Males moved rapidly through the landscape, particularly when released during the night. Although males moved further than what is typically observed in females of the species, survival was considerably lower. These unique insights will lead to a greater understanding of mating interactions in wild insect populations and lay the foundation for robust suppression strategies in the future.

Author SummaryModern scientific techniques for controlling populations of the dengue vector, Aedes aegypti, utilize the mating biology of adult male mosquitoes to achieve suppression through a sterilization process. As the study of Ae. aegypti control has typically focused on adult female mosquitoes, knowledge on male movement, survival and mating interactions in the field is lacking. Here we undertook several mark-release-recapture experiments on adult male Ae. aegypti in Innisfail, Australia, and measured important biological parameters. For the first time in large field experiments, we employed rhodamine B as a marker that when fed to adult males, identified both marked males and the wild females they mated with. We observed males moving further through the landscape, but surviving for a shorter period, than previous measurements undertaken on females in a field setting. A high proportion (~40%) of unmated females suggests individuals are constantly available for mating. As such, sterile male strategies may need to release at regular intervals to achieve effective population suppression. The unique insights provided by this study will assist in designing future sterile male field interventions.",2020-11-04,ecology,Dengue,Dengue,rapid advances in biological and digital technologies are revolutionizing the population control of invasive disease vectors such as aedes aegypti methods such as the sterile and incompatible insect techniques sit iit rely on modified males to seek out and successfully mate with females and in doing so outcompete the wild male population for mates currently these interventions infer the success of mating interactions between male and female insects through area wide population surveillance and observations of mating competitiveness are rare furthermore little is known about male ae aegypti behaviours and biology in field settings in preparation for a large community scale iit program we undertook a series of mark release recapture experiments using rhodamine b to mark male ae aegypti sperm and measure mating interactions with females we also developed the spatial and temporally evolving isotropic kernel steik framework to assist researchers to estimate the movement of individuals through space and time results showed that of daily females captured were unmated suggesting interventions will need to release males regularly to be effective at suppressing ae aegypti populations males moved rapidly through the landscape particularly when released during the night although males moved further than what is typically observed in females of the species survival was considerably lower these unique insights will lead to a greater understanding of mating interactions in wild insect populations and lay the foundation for robust suppression strategies in the future author summarymodern scientific techniques for controlling populations of the dengue vector aedes aegypti utilize the mating biology of adult male mosquitoes to achieve suppression through a sterilization process as the study of ae aegypti control has typically focused on adult female mosquitoes knowledge on male movement survival and mating interactions in the field is lacking here we undertook several mark release recapture experiments on adult male ae aegypti in innisfail australia and measured important biological parameters for the first time in large field experiments we employed rhodamine b as a marker that when fed to adult males identified both marked males and the wild females they mated with we observed males moving further through the landscape but surviving for a shorter period than previous measurements undertaken on females in a field setting a high proportion of unmated females suggests individuals are constantly available for mating as such sterile male strategies may need to release at regular intervals to achieve effective population suppression the unique insights provided by this study will assist in designing future sterile male field interventions,rapid advance biological digital technology revolutionize population control invasive disease vector aede aegypti method sterile incompatible insect technique sit iit rely modify male seek successfully mate female outcompete wild male population mate currently intervention infer success mating interaction male female insect area wide population surveillance observation mate competitiveness rare furthermore little know male aegypti behaviour biology field setting preparation large community scale iit program undertake series mark release recapture experiment use rhodamine mark male aegypti sperm measure mate interaction female also develop spatial temporally evolve isotropic kernel steik framework assist researcher estimate movement individual space time result show daily female capture unmated suggesting intervention need release male regularly effective suppress aegypti population male move rapidly landscape particularly release night although male move typically observe female species survival considerably lower unique insight lead great understanding mating interaction wild insect population lie foundation robust suppression strategy future author summarymodern scientific technique controlling population dengue vector aedes aegypti utilize mate biology adult male mosquito achieve suppression sterilization process study aegypti control typically focus adult female mosquito knowledge male movement survival mate interaction field lack undertake several mark release recapture experiment adult male aegypti innisfail australia measure important biological parameter first time large field experiment employ rhodamine marker fed adult male identify marked male wild female mate observed male move landscape survive short period previous measurement undertake female field set high proportion unmate female suggest individual constantly available mate sterile male strategy may need release regular interval achieve effective population suppression unique insight provide study assist design future sterile male field intervention
10.1101/2020.03.17.995738,Repurposing Old Antibodies for New Diseases by Exploiting Cross Reactivity and Multicolored Nanoparticles,"We exploit the cross-reactivity of dengue (DENV) and zika (ZIKV) virus polyclonal antibodies for nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) to construct a selective sensor that can detect yellow fever virus (YFV) NS1 in a manner similar to chemical olfaction. DENV and ZIKV antibodies were screened for their ability to bind to DENV, ZIKV, and YFV NS1 by ELISA and in pairs in paper immunoassays. A strategic arrangement of antibodies immobilized on paper and conjugated to different colored gold NPs was used to distinguish the three biomarkers. Machine learning of test area RGB values showed that with two spots, readout accuracies of 100% and 87% were obtained for both pure NS1 and DENV/YFV mixtures, respectively. Additional image pre-processing allowed differentiation between all 4 DENV serotypes with 92% accuracy. The technique was extended to hack a commercial DENV test to detect YFV and ZIKV by augmentation with DENV and ZIKV polyclonal antibodies.

These prodrugs also display potent anti-dengue activities in cellular assays although their prodrug moieties were designed to produce high levels of triphosphate in the liver. Since peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are one of the major targets of dengue virus, different prodrug moieties were designed to effectively deliver 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-2-C-methylguanosine monophosphate prodrugs and their corresponding triphosphates into PBMCs after oral administration. We identified a cyclic phosphoramidate prodrug 17 demonstrating a well-balanced anti-dengue cellular activity and in vitro stability profiles. In dogs, oral administration of 17 resulted in high PBMC triphosphate level, exceeding TP50 (the intracellular triphosphate concentration at which 50% of virus replication is inhibited) at 10 mg/kg. Compound 17 demonstrated 1.6- and 2.2 log viremia reduction in the dengue mouse model at 100 and 300 mg/kg twice daily, respectively. At 100 mg/kg twice daily, the terminal triphosphate concentration in PBMCs reached above TP50, defining for the first time the minimum efficacious dose for a nucleos(t)ide prodrug. In the two-week dog toxicity studies at 30 to 300 mg/kg/day, no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) could not be achieved due to pulmonary inflammation and hemorrhage.

Harmonized field protocols help to build a comprehensive picture on species-specific vector ecology and generate important knowledge for implementing coordinated mosquito surveillance programs at regional scales and across continents. In this study, we test the efficiency and potential barriers of available harmonized protocols from earlier EU project VectorNet. As a kind of litmus test for such protocols, we specifically aim to capture the ecoregional variation of breeding site characteristics and population density of five mosquito vectors in Europe and Africa. As expected, the five species considered show different aquatic habitat preferences. Culex pipiens, Aedes albopictus in Europe and Ae. aegypti in Africa select breeding habitats within specific volume classes, while Anopheles gambiae and An. coluzzii may select breeding habitats based on seasonal availability. Population densities in aquatic habitats greatly varied across species and countries, but larval production sites of Ae. albopictus generate populations with higher ratio of pupae compared to the other species. This result underlines the fundamental ecological difference between the selected vector species disregarding of the ecoregion. Mean water temperatures had limited variation across species and higher among countries. Understanding the ecology of native and non-native mosquito vectors is key in evaluating transmission risks for diseases such as West Nile, chikungunya and dengue fevers, zika and malaria.

10.1101/2019.12.20.883363,Empirical dynamic modeling reveals ecological drivers of dengue dynamics,"Experiments and models suggest that climate affects mosquito-borne disease transmission. However, disease transmission involves complex nonlinear interactions between climate and population dynamics, which makes detecting climate drivers at the population level challenging. By analyzing incidence data, estimated susceptible population size, and climate data with methods based on nonlinear time series analysis (collectively referred to as empirical dynamic modeling), we identified drivers and their interactive effects on dengue dynamics in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Climatic forcing arose only when susceptible availability was high: temperature and rainfall had net positive and negative effects, respectively. By capturing mechanistic, nonlinear, and context-dependent effects of population susceptibility, temperature, and rainfall on dengue transmission empirically, our model improves forecast skill over recent, state-of-the-art models for dengue incidence.

The human K562 cell line supports DENV replication and represent Megakaryocyte-Erythrocyte progenitors (MEP), replicating features of in vivo Megakaryopoiesis upon stimulation with Phorbol esters. In this article, we report results that indicate the mutual influence of Megakaryopoiesis and DENV replication on each other, through comparison of PMA-induced differentiation of either mock-infected or DENV-infected K562 cells. We present data showing PMA-induced differentiation to drastically increase DENV replication and a concomitant augmented secretion of infectious virus. Although the mechanism is not clear yet, we show that it is not through an increased uptake of virus by differentiated cells. On the other hand, DENV replication in cells undergoing PMA-induced differentiation, interferes with major differentiation markers of Megakaryopoiesis including activation of ERK1/2 MAP Kinase, endomitosis and surface expression of platelet-specific proteins without any drastic effect on cell death. Among signaling intermediaries of the JAK-STAT pathway, we observed infection associated degradation of SOC3 protein similar to earlier observations with STAT2. DENV infection leads to accumulation of Reactive-oxygen species (ROS) in different cells including K562. PMA-induced differentiation of uninfected K562 cells also leads to intracellular ROS accumulation. Interestingly, we observed ROS accumulation to be suppressed by concomitant DENV replication in K562 cells undergoing PMA-induced differentiation. This is the first report of a model system where DENV replication suppresses intracellular ROS accumulation.

The 3' UTRs of MBFVs contain regions of high sequence conservation in structured RNA elements known as dumbbells (DBs) that regulate translation and replication of the viral RNA genome, functions proposed to depend on the formation of an RNA pseudoknot. To understand how DB structure provides this function, we used x-ray crystallography and structural modeling to reveal the details of its three-dimensional fold. The structure confirmed the predicted pseudoknot and molecular modeling revealed how conserved sequences form a four-way junction that appears to stabilize the pseudoknot. Single-molecule FRET suggests that the DB pseudoknot is a stable element that can regulate the switch between translation and replication during the viral lifecycle by modulating long-range RNA conformational changes.",2020-09-17,microbiology,Dengue,Dengue,mosquito borne flaviviruses mbfvs including dengue west nile yellow fever and zika viruses have an rna genome encoding one open reading frame flanked by and untranslated regions utrs the utrs of mbfvs contain regions of high sequence conservation in structured rna elements known as dumbbells dbs that regulate translation and replication of the viral rna genome functions proposed to depend on the formation of an rna pseudoknot to understand how db structure provides this function we used x ray crystallography and structural modeling to reveal the details of its three dimensional fold the structure confirmed the predicted pseudoknot and molecular modeling revealed how conserved sequences form a four way junction that appears to stabilize the pseudoknot single molecule fret suggests that the db pseudoknot is a stable element that can regulate the switch between translation and replication during the viral lifecycle by modulating long range rna conformational changes,mosquito borne flaviviruse mbfvs include dengue west nile yellow fever zika viruse rna genome encode one open reading frame flank untranslated region utr utrs mbfvs contain region high sequence conservation structure rna element know dumbbell dbs regulate translation replication viral rna genome function propose depend formation rna pseudoknot understand structure provide function use ray crystallography structural modeling reveal detail three dimensional fold structure confirm predict pseudoknot molecular modeling reveal conserve sequence form four way junction appear stabilize pseudoknot single molecule fret suggest pseudoknot stable element regulate switch translation replication viral lifecycle modulate long range rna conformational change
10.1101/2020.09.09.290031,"American mammals susceptibility to dengue according to geographical, environmental and phylogenetic distances","Many human emergent and re-emergent diseases have a sylvatic cycle. Yet, little effort has been put into discovering and modeling the wild mammal reservoirs of dengue (DENV), particularly in the Americas. Here, we show a species-level susceptibility prediction to dengue of wild mammals in the Americas as a function of the three most important biodiversity dimensions (ecological, geographical, and phylogenetic spaces), using machine learning protocols. Model predictions showed that different species of bats would be highly susceptible to DENV infections, where susceptibility mostly depended on phylogenetic relationships among hosts and their environmental requirement. Mammal species predicted as highly susceptible coincide with sets of species that have been reported infected in field studies, but it also suggests other species that have not been previously considered or that have been captured in low numbers. Also, the environment (i.e., the distance between the species optima in bioclimatic dimensions) in combination with geographic and phylogenetic distance is highly relevant in predicting susceptibility to DENV in wild mammals. Our results agree with previous modeling efforts indicating that temperature is an important factor determining DENV transmission, and provide novel insights regarding other relevant factors and the importance of considering wild reservoirs.

The Wolbachia strain colonizing Drosophila melanogaster creates sperm-egg incompatibilities and protects its host against RNA viruses, making it a promising tool for vector control. Despite successful trials using Wolbachia-transfected mosquitoes for Dengue control, knowledge of how Wolbachia and viruses jointly affect insect biology remains limited. Using the Drosophila model, transcriptomics and gene expression network analyses revealed pathways with altered expression and splicing due to Wolbachia colonization and virus infection. Included are metabolic pathways previously unknown to be important for Wolbachia-host interactions. Additionally, Wolbachia-colonized flies exhibit a dampened transcriptomic response to virus infection, consistent with early blocking of virus replication.

10.1101/2020.06.02.129460,Species composition and risk of transmission of Aedes-borne arboviruses around some Yellow hotspot areas in Northern Ghana,"Aedes-borne viral diseases mainly Yellow Fever (YF), Dengue (DEN), Zika (ZIK) and Chikungunya (CHK) have contributed to many deaths in the world especially in Africa. There have been major outbreaks of these diseases in West Africa. YF outbreaks have occurred in Ghana. Although Ghana has not recorded any outbreak of DEN, ZIK and CHK, the risk is high due to its proximity to West African countries where outbreaks have been recently been recorded. This study assessed the risk of transmission of Yellow fever (YFV), Dengue (DENV), Chikungunya (CHKV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses in Larabanga and Mole Game Reserve areas in Northern Ghana. The immature and adult stages of Aedes mosquitoes were collected from Larabanga and Mole Game Reserve area. There was a significant (P>0.001) number of mosquitoes collected during the rainy season than the dry season. A total of 1,930 Aedes mosquitoes were collected during the rainy season and morphologically identified. Of these, 1,915 (99.22%) were Aedes aegypti and 15 (0.22%) were Aedes vittatus. During the dry season, 27 Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were collected. A total of 415 Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were molecularly identified to subspecies level of which Aedes (Ae) aegypti aegypti was the predominant subspecies. Both Ae. aegypti aegypti and Ae aegypti formosus exist in sympatry in the area. All Aedes pools (75) were negative for DENV, ZIKV and CHKV when examined by RT-PCR. Three Larval indices namely House Index, HI (percentage of houses positive for Aedes larvae or pupae), Container Index, CI (the percentage of containers positive for Aedes larvae or pupae) and Breteau Index, BI (the number of positive containers (with larvae and/or pupae per 100 inspected houses) were assessed as a measure for risk of transmission. The HI, CI and BI for both sites were as follows; Mole game reserve (HI, 42.1%, CI, 23.5% and BI, 100 for rainy season and 0 for all indices for dry season) and Larabanga (39%, 15.5% and 61 for rainy season and 2.3%, 1.3% and 2.3 for dry season). The spatial distribution of Aedes breeding sites in both areas indicated that Aedes larvae were breeding in areas with close proximity to humans. Lorry tires were the main source of Aedes larvae in all the study areas.

Field Isolates from Southern India,"Aedes spp. mosquitoes are a major health concern as they transmit several viral pathogens resulting in millions of deaths annually around the world. This is compounded by the emergence of insecticide-resistant strains and global warming, which could expose more than half of the world's population to Aedes-borne diseases in the future. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of vector biology and the genomic basis of phenotypes such as insecticide resistance in natural populations are of paramount importance. Here, we sequenced the genome of Aedes aegypti mosquitos sampled from dengue-endemic areas and investigated the genetic variations between the previously reported laboratory-reared strain and our field isolates. The mosquito genomic DNA was used for paired-end sequencing using the Illumina platform. The reads were used for template-based assembly and mapped to the Aedes aegypti reference genome. Stringent parameters and multiple variant calling methods were used to identify unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions-deletions (indels) and mapped to the Aedes chromosomes to create a draft consensus genome. Gene Ontology analyses was performed on the variant-enriched genes while two gene families involved in insecticide resistance were used for comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses. Comparative sequence variant analyses showed that the majority of the high-quality variants in our samples mapped to non-coding regions of the genome, while gene ontology analyses of genic variants revealed enrichment of terms relevant to drug binding and insecticide resistance. Importantly, one mutation implicated in pyrethroid resistance was found in one Aedes sample. This is the first report of genome sequences of A. aegypti field isolates from India which reveals variants specific to the wild population.

10.1101/2020.11.07.368720,Non-canonical odor coding ensures unbreakable mosquito attraction to humans,"Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are a persistent human foe, transmitting arboviruses including dengue and yellow fever when they bite us to obtain a blood meal. Mosquitoes are intensely attracted to human-emitted body odor, heat, and carbon dioxide, which they detect using three different large multi-gene families encoding odor-gated ion channels. Genetic mutations that cause profound disruptions to the olfactory system have modest effects on human attraction, suggesting significant redundancy in odor coding. The canonical view is that olfactory sensory neurons each express a single chemosensory receptor that defines its ligand selectivity. Using immunostaining, RNA in situ hybridization, and single nucleus RNA sequencing, we discovered that Aedes aegypti uses an entirely different organizational principle, with many neurons co-expressing multiple chemosensory receptor genes. In vivo electrophysiology demonstrates that the broad ligand-sensitivity of mosquito olfactory neurons is due to this non-canonical co-expression. The redundancy afforded by an olfactory system in which many neurons co-express multiple receptors with different chemical sensitivity may greatly increase the robustness of the mosquito olfactory system and explain our longstanding inability to engineer new compounds that disrupt the detection of human body odor by mosquitoes.",2020-11-08,neuroscience,Dengue,Dengue,female aedes aegypti mosquitoes are a persistent human foe transmitting arboviruses including dengue and yellow fever when they bite us to obtain a blood meal mosquitoes are intensely attracted to human emitted body odor heat and carbon dioxide which they detect using three different large multi gene families encoding odor gated ion channels genetic mutations that cause profound disruptions to the olfactory system have modest effects on human attraction suggesting significant redundancy in odor coding the canonical view is that olfactory sensory neurons each express a single chemosensory receptor that defines its ligand selectivity using immunostaining rna in situ hybridization and single nucleus rna sequencing we discovered that aedes aegypti uses an entirely different organizational principle with many neurons co expressing multiple chemosensory receptor genes in vivo electrophysiology demonstrates that the broad ligand sensitivity of mosquito olfactory neurons is due to this non canonical co expression the redundancy afforded by an olfactory system in which many neurons co express multiple receptors with different chemical sensitivity may greatly increase the robustness of the mosquito olfactory system and explain our longstanding inability to engineer new compounds that disrupt the detection of human body odor by mosquitoes,female aede aegypti mosquitoes persistent human foe transmitting arbovirus include dengue yellow fever bite obtain blood meal mosquito intensely attract human emit body odor heat carbon dioxide detect use three different large multi gene family encode odor gate ion channel genetic mutation cause profound disruption olfactory system modest effect human attraction suggest significant redundancy odor code canonical view olfactory sensory neuron express single chemosensory receptor define ligand selectivity use immunostaine rna situ hybridization single nucleus rna sequence discover aede aegypti use entirely different organizational principle many neuron express multiple chemosensory receptor gene vivo electrophysiology demonstrate broad ligand sensitivity mosquito olfactory neuron due non canonical expression redundancy afford olfactory system many neuron express multiple receptor different chemical sensitivity may greatly increase robustness mosquito olfactory system explain longstanding inability engineer new compound disrupt detection human body odor mosquito
10.1101/2020.08.27.269720,Epidemiology of Dengue viral infection in Nepal: 2006-2019,"BackgroundDengue is one of the newest emerging diseases in Nepal with increasing burden and geographic spread over the last 14 years. The main objective of this study was to explore the spatio-temporal epidemiological patterns of Dengue since its first report (2006) till 2019 in Nepal.

MethodsThis study is a retrospective analysis of dengue data available from the Epidemiological Disease Control Division (EDCD) of Government of Nepal. The data in this study cover the last 14 years (2006-2019) of reported dengue cases in Nepal. Epidemiological trend and spatio-temporal analyses were performed. Maps of reported case incidence were created using QGIS version 3.4.

ResultsSince the first report of dengue in a foreigner in 2004, Nepal reported a total of 17,992 dengue cases in 68 districts of Nepal in 2019. The incidence was approximately five times higher in 2018 (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR): 4.8; 95% CI: 1.5 - 15.3) and over 140 times higher in 2019 (IRR: 141.6; CI: 45.8 - 438.4). Population density was not a statistically significant predictor of case incidence. Mean elevation had a negative association with case incidence. A one standard deviation increase in elevation was associated with a 90% decrease in reported case incidence (IRR: 0.10; CI: 0.01 - 0.20). However, the association with mean elevation varied across the years. In comparison to 2016, incidence was greater at higher elevations in 2018 (IRR: 22.7; CI: 6.0 - 86.1) and 2019 (IRR: 9.6; CI: 2.6 - 36.1).

ConclusionThere is a high risk of dengue outbreak in the Terai region with increasing spread towards the mid-mountains and beyond as seen over the last 14 years. Urgent measures are required to increase the availability of diagnostics and resources to mitigate future dengue epidemics. Findings from this study can inform the spatio-temporal distribution of dengue and can help in resource allocation and priority setting for future epidemic.

Author summaryDengue in humans is caused by four different serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 & DENV-4). Globally it is the most pervasive vector borne diseases with increasing number of cases in recent years. Dengue is one of the youngest emerging diseases in Nepal with increasing cases and spread from the tropical lowland to the highland (hilly) regions. We conducted a spatio-temporal analysis of national data to consolidate the information using QGIS to measure the dengue incidence at district levels of Nepal. Spatio-temporal analysis exploring the incidence and distribution of dengue cases aids in identification of high-risk areas which can ultimately enable national dengue programme to mobilize and allocate resources for the control and treatment.

10.1101/2020.10.27.354563,Aglycone polyether ionophores as broad-spectrum agents inhibit multiple enveloped viruses including SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and successfully cure JEV infected mice,"Infections with zoonotic viruses, such as flaviviruses, influenza virus, and the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic coronavirus constitute an increasing global risk. Hence, an urgent need exists for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals to prevent such outbreaks. Here, we show that the maduramycin and CP-80,219 aglycone polyether ionophores exhibit effective broad-spectrum antiviral activity, against various viruses, including Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), while also exhibiting promising activity against PR8 influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2.

10.1101/2020.05.19.104372,"Household and climate factors influence Aedes aegypti risk in the arid city of Huaquillas, Ecuador","Arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti (e.g., dengue, chikungunya, Zika) are of major public health concern on the arid coastal border of Ecuador and Peru. This high transit border is a critical disease surveillance site due to human movement-associated risk of transmission. Local level studies are thus integral to capturing the dynamics and distribution of vector populations and social-ecological drivers of risk, to inform targeted public health interventions. Our study examines factors associated with household-level Ae. aegypti presence in Huaquillas, Ecuador, while accounting for spatial and temporal effects. From January to May of 2017, adult mosquitoes were collected from a cohort of households (n = 63) in clusters (n = 10), across the city of Huaquillas, using aspirator backpacks. Household surveys describing housing conditions, demographics, economics, travel, disease prevention, and city services were conducted by local enumerators. This study was conducted during the normal arbovirus transmission season (January - May), but during an exceptionally dry year. Household level Ae. aegypti presence peaked in February, and counts were highest in weeks with high temperatures and a week after increased rainfall. Presence of Ae. aegypti was highly variable between clusters. Hierarchical generalized linear models were used to explore household social-ecological variables and female Ae. aegypti presence. Houses with Ae. aegypti used larvicide in water tanks and had high awareness of dengue transmission. We found that homes were more likely to have Ae. aegypti when heads of household had lived in the neighborhoods for longer than average (>22 years), when households had more occupants than average (>4.5), had a female head of household, and received more frequent garbage collection. Ae. aegypti presence was less likely in households with reliable water supply and septic systems. Based on our findings, infrastructure access, urban occupancy patterns, and seasonal climate are important considerations for vector control in this city, and even in dry years, this arid environment supports Ae. aegypti breeding habitat.

Author summaryMosquito transmitted infectious diseases are a growing concern around the world. The yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti) has been responsible for recent major outbreaks of disease, including dengue fever and Zika. This mosquito prefers to bite humans and lay its eggs in artificial containers such as water tanks and planters. This makes Ae. aegypti well suited to become established in growing urban areas. Controlling these mosquitoes has been an important way to reduce the risk of disease transmission. Studies that are undertaken to understand local factors that contribute to the continued survival of the mosquito can be used to inform control practices. We conducted a study in the largest city on the border of Ecuador and Peru where we collected adult mosquitoes from houses and surveyed household members about their behaviors, perceptions, and housing infrastructure associated with the mosquito vector. Mosquitoes were most numerous in weeks with high temperatures and a week after increased rainfall. Larvicide was a commonly used control strategy in homes where Ae. aegypti was present. We found that houses that had more people, female heads of household, heads of household that had lived in the neighborhood for a long time, and had unreliable water service, were more likely have

Recent advances in transgenic technology have yielded important new insight into the biology of this disease vector. The early development of neurogenetic tools, in particular, is beginning to shed light on the neural basis of behaviors that allow Ae. aegypti to thrive in human environments and find and bite human hosts. Despite these advances, a pan-neuronal expression driver remains elusive. Pan-neuronal drivers give researchers genetic access to all neurons and thus provide a critical entry point for circuit dissection. Here, we describe our efforts to generate pan-neuronal drivers in Ae. aegypti via targeted knock-in of in-frame reporter constructs to the native coding sequence of broadly expressed neural genes with CRISPR/Cas9. Two of five attempts were successful, resulting in a Syt1:GCaMP6s strain that expresses synaptically-localized GCaMP in all neurons and a brp-T2A-QF2w driver strain that can be used to drive and amplify expression of any effector in all neurons via the Q binary system.

Using geometric morphometry analysis, Aedes aegypti wing size and shape variation of males and females was studied in four altitudes in the second-smallest department in Colombia: 1.200 m (Tebaida), 1.400 m (Armenia), 1.500 m (Calarca), and 1.700 m (Filandia). Wing shape in males (P < 0.001) and females (P < 0.001) was significantly different through the altitudinal gradient; in turn, wing size in males followed the altitudinal gradient (Males R2 = 0.04946, P = 0.0002), Females (R2 = 0.0011, P = 0.46). Wing allometry for males (P < 0.001) and females (P < 0.001) was significant. Likewise, the shape and size of the wings of males (P < 0.001) and females (P < 0.001) had significant fluctuating asymmetry. It is concluded that, in a small scale with an altitudinal variation of 500 meters, it is detected that the size and shape of the wings varied in A. aegypti, principal vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika.

10.1101/2020.09.16.299487,"Wing Geometry and Genetic Analyses Reveal Contrasting Spatial Structures between Male and Female Aedes aegypti Populations in Metropolitan Manila, Philippines","BackgroundMany important arboviral diseases (e.g. dengue, chikungunya) are transmitted by the bite of a female mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. Hence, the population genetic structure of the mosquito has been studied in order to understand its role as an efficient vector. Several studies utilized an integrative approach; to combine genetic and phenotypic data to determine the population structure of Ae. aegypti but these studies have only focused on female populations. To address this particular gap, our study compared the population variability and structuring between male and female Ae. aegypti populations using phenotypic (wing geometry) and genetic (microsatellites) data from a highly-urbanized and dengue-endemic region of the Philippines, Metropolitan Manila.

MethodsFive mosquito populations comprised of female (n = 137) and male (n = 49) adult Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were used in this study. All mosquito individuals underwent geometric morphometric (26 landmarks), and genetic (11 microsatellite loci) analyses.

ResultsResults revealed that FST estimates (genetic) were 0.055 and 0.009 while QST estimates (phenotypic) were 0.318 and 0.309 in in male and female populations, respectively. Wing shape variation plots showed that male populations were distinctly separated from each other while female populations overlapped. Similarly, discriminant analysis of principal components using genetic data revealed that male populations were also distinctly separated from each other while female populations showed near-overlapping populations. Genetic and phenetic dendrograms showed the formation of two groups in male populations but no groups in female populations. Further analysis indicated a significant correlation (r = 0.68, p = 0.02) between the genetic and phenetic distances of male populations. Bayesian analysis using genetic data also detected multiple clusters in male (K = 3) and female (K = 2) populations, while no clusters were detected using the phenotypic data from both sexes.

ConclusionsOur results revealed contrasting phenotypic and genetic patterns between male and female Ae. aegypti, indicating that male populations were more spatially structured than female populations.

10.1101/2020.01.25.919878,An Autoencoder and Artificial Neural Network-based Method to Estimate Parity Status of Wild Mosquitoes from Near-infrared Spectra,"BackgroundAfter mating, female mosquitoes need animal blood to develop their eggs. In the process of acquiring blood, they may acquire pathogens, which may cause different diseases to humans such as malaria, zika, dengue, and chikungunya. Therefore, knowing the parity status of mosquitoes is useful in control and evaluation of infectious diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, where parous mosquitoes are assumed to be potentially infectious. Ovary dissections, which currently are used to determine the parity status of mosquitoes, are very tedious and limited to very few experts. An alternative to ovary dissections is near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which can estimate the age in days and the infectious state of laboratory and semi-field reared mosquitoes with accuracies between 80 and 99%. No study has tested the accuracy of NIRS for estimating the parity status of wild mosquitoes.

Methods and resultsIn this study, we train artificial neural network (ANN) models on NIR spectra to estimate the parity status of wild mosquitoes. We use four different datasets: An. arabiensis collected from Minepa, Tanzania (Minepa-ARA); An. gambiae collected from Muleba, Tanzania (Muleba-GA); An. gambiae collected from Burkina Faso (Burkina-GA); and An.gambiae from Muleba and Burkina Faso combined (Muleba-Burkina-GA). We train ANN models on datasets with spectra preprocessed according to previous protocols. We then use autoencoders to reduce the spectra feature dimensions from 1851 to 10 and re-train ANN models. Before the autoencoder was applied, ANN models estimated parity status of mosquitoes in Minepa-ARA, Muleba-GA, Burkina-GA and Muleba-Burkina-GA with out-of-sample accuracies of 81.9 {+/-} 2.8% (N=927), 68.7 {+/-} 4.8% (N=140), 80.3 {+/-} 2.0% (N=158), and 75.7 {+/-} 2.5% (N=298), respectively. With the autoencoder, ANN models tested on out-of-sample data achieved 97.1 {+/-} 2.2%, (N=927), 89.8 {+/-} 1.7% (N=140), 93.3 {+/-} 1.2% (N=158), and 92.7 {+/-} 1.8% (N=298) accuracies for Minepa-ARA, Muleba-GA, Burkina-GA, and Muleba-Burkina-GA, respectively.

ConclusionThese results show that a combination of an autoencoder and an ANN trained on NIR spectra to estimate parity status of wild mosquitoes yields models that can be used as an alternative tool to estimate parity status of wild mosquitoes, especially since NIRS is a high-throughput, reagent-free, and simple-to-use technique compared to ovary dissections.",2020-01-26,bioinformatics,Dengue,Dengue,backgroundafter mating female mosquitoes need animal blood to develop their eggs in the process of acquiring blood they may acquire pathogens which may cause different diseases to humans such as malaria zika dengue and chikungunya therefore knowing the parity status of mosquitoes is useful in control and evaluation of infectious diseases transmitted by mosquitoes where parous mosquitoes are assumed to be potentially infectious ovary dissections which currently are used to determine the parity status of mosquitoes are very tedious and limited to very few experts an alternative to ovary dissections is near infrared spectroscopy nirs which can estimate the age in days and the infectious state of laboratory and semi field reared mosquitoes with accuracies between and no study has tested the accuracy of nirs for estimating the parity status of wild mosquitoes methods and resultsin this study we train artificial neural network ann models on nir spectra to estimate the parity status of wild mosquitoes we use four different datasets an arabiensis collected from minepa tanzania minepa ara an gambiae collected from muleba tanzania muleba ga an gambiae collected from burkina faso burkina ga and an gambiae from muleba and burkina faso combined muleba burkina ga we train ann models on datasets with spectra preprocessed according to previous protocols we then use autoencoders to reduce the spectra feature dimensions from to and re train ann models before the autoencoder was applied ann models estimated parity status of mosquitoes in minepa ara muleba ga burkina ga and muleba burkina ga with out of sample accuracies of n n n and n respectively with the autoencoder ann models tested on out of sample data achieved n n n and n accuracies for minepa ara muleba ga burkina ga and muleba burkina ga respectively conclusionthese results show that a combination of an autoencoder and an ann trained on nir spectra to estimate parity status of wild mosquitoes yields models that can be used as an alternative tool to estimate parity status of wild mosquitoes especially since nirs is a high throughput reagent free and simple to use technique compared to ovary dissections,backgroundafter mate female mosquito need animal blood develop egg process acquire blood may acquire pathogen may cause different disease human malaria zika dengue chikungunya therefore know parity status mosquitoe useful control evaluation infectious disease transmit mosquito parous mosquito assume potentially infectious ovary dissection currently use determine parity status mosquitoe tedious limited expert alternative ovary dissection near infrared spectroscopy nir estimate age day infectious state laboratory semi field rear mosquito accuracy study test accuracy nir estimate parity status wild mosquito method resultsin study train artificial neural network ann model nir spectra estimate parity status wild mosquito use four different dataset arabiensis collect minepa tanzania minepa ara gambiae collect muleba tanzania muleba gambiae collect burkina faso burkina gambiae muleba burkina faso combined muleba burkina train ann model dataset spectra preprocesse accord previous protocol use autoencoder reduce spectra feature dimension train ann model autoencoder apply ann model estimate parity status mosquitoe minepa ara muleba burkina muleba burkina sample accuracy respectively autoencoder ann model test sample datum achieve accuracy minepa ara muleba burkina muleba burkina respectively conclusionthese result show combination autoencoder ann train nir spectra estimate parity status wild mosquito yield model use alternative tool estimate parity status wild mosquito especially since nir high throughput reagent free simple use technique compare ovary dissection

Lack of arbovirus proliferation in midgut cells has been observed in several Aedes aegypti strains2, but the midgut antiviral responses underlying this phenomenon are not yet fully understood. We report here that there is a rapid induction of apoptosis (RIA) in the Aedes aegypti midgut epithelium within 2 hours of infection with DENV-2 or ZIKV in both in vivo blood-feeding and ex vivo midgut infection models.

10.1101/2020.03.30.016022,Old drugs with new tricks: Efficacy of fluoroquinolones to suppress replication of flaviviruses,"Antiviral therapies are urgently needed to treat infections with flaviviruses such as Zika (ZIKV) and dengue (DENV) virus. Repurposing FDA-approved compounds could provide the fastest route to alleviate the burden of flaviviral diseases. In this study, three fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, difloxacin and ciprofloxacin, curtailed replication of flaviviruses ZIKV, DENV, Langat (LGTV) and Modoc (MODV) in HEK-293 cells at low micromolar concentrations. Time-of-addition assays revealed that enoxacin suppressed ZIKV replication when added at 6 hours post-infection, suggesting inhibition of an intermediate step in the virus life cycle, whereas ciprofloxacin and difloxacin had a wider window of efficacy of 2, 6, and 8 hours post-infection for difloxacin and 2 to 8 hours post-infection for ciprofloxacin. The efficacy of enoxacin to suppress ZIKV replication in 5-week-old A129 mice was evaluated in two experiments. First, mice were infected with 1x105 plaque-forming units (pfu) ZIKV FSS13025 (n=20) or PBS (n=11) on day 0 and subsets were treated with enoxacin at 10mg/kg or 15mg/kg or diluent orally twice daily on days 1-5. Treated and control mice did not differ in weight change or virus titer in serum or brain. Mice treated with enoxacin showed a significant, 5-fold decrease in ZIKV titer in testes relative to controls. Second, mice were infected with 1x102 pfu ZIKV (n=13) or PBS (n=13) on day 0 and subsets were treated with 15mg/kg oral enoxacin or diluent twice daily on days 0 (pre-treatment) and 1-5. Mice treated with enoxacin showed a significant, 2.5-fold decrease in ZIKV titer in testes relative to controls, while weight and viral load in the serum, brain, and liver did not differ between treated and control mice. Enoxacin efficacy in cultured murine Sertoli cells was not enhanced compared to efficacy in HEK-293 cells. ZIKV can be sexually transmitted, so reduction of titer in the testes by enoxacin should be further investigated.

Author SummaryFlaviviruses such as Zika and dengue virus pose a significant threat to public health worldwide, and there are currently no antiviral therapies to treat any flaviviral infection. Repurposing FDA-approved drugs as anti-flaviviral therapies can accelerate clinical use. We demonstrated that fluoroquinolone antibiotics exhibit anti-flaviviral efficacy, suppressing flavivirus replication in cultured human cells. Additionally, we found that the fluoroquinolone enoxacin suppressed Zika virus replication in mouse testes. While Zika virus is primarily transmitted via mosquitoes, the virus also undergoes sexual transmission. The importance of sexual transmission for the overall epidemiology of the virus remains unclear; nonetheless all routes of potential transmission to pregnant women are of concern as fetal infection in utero can have devastating effects. Thus, our data indicate that fluoroquinolones hold promise for treatment of flaviviral infections, particularly infection of the testes by Zika virus, and that this class of drugs warrants further

10.1101/2020.05.15.097782,Field efficacy of guppies and pyriproxyfen (Sumilarv(R) 2MR) combined with community engagement on dengue vectors in Cambodia: a randomized controlled trial,"Evidence on the effectiveness of low-cost, sustainable biological vector control tools for Aedes mosquitoes is limited. Therefore, the purpose of this trial is to estimate the impact of guppy fish, in combination with the use of the larvicide Pyriproxyfen (Sumilarv(R) 2MR), and Communication for Behavioral Impact (COMBI) activities to reduce entomological indices in Cambodia.

In this cluster randomized, controlled superiority trial, 30 clusters comprising of one or more villages each (with approximately 170 households) will be allocated, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive either a) three interventions (guppies, Sumilarv(R) 2MR, and COMBI activities), b) two interventions (guppies and COMBI activities), or c) control (standard vector control).

Households were invited to participate, and entomology surveys among 40 randomly selected households per cluster were carried out quarterly. The primary outcome was the population density of adult female Aedes mosquitoes (i.e. number per house) trapped using adult resting collections. Secondary outcome measures include the House index, Container index, Breteau index, Pupae Per House, Pupae Per Person, mosquito infection rate, guppy fish coverage, Sumilarv(R) 2MR coverage, and percentage of respondents with knowledge about Aedes mosquitoes causing dengue. In the primary analysis, adult female Aedes density and mosquito infection rates was aggregated over follow-up time points to give a single rate per cluster. This was analyzed by negative binomial regression, yielding density ratios.

The number of Aedes females was reduced by roughly half compared to the control in both the guppy and PPF arm (Density Ratio (DR)=0.54 [95% CI 0.34-0.85], p=0.0073), and guppy arm (DR=0.49 [95% CI 0.31-0.77], p=0.0021). The extremely low cost of including guppy rearing in community-based health structures along with the effectiveness demonstrated suggest guppies should be considered as a vector control tool as long as the benefits outweigh any potential environmental concerns. PPF was also highly accepted and preferred over current vector control tools used in Cambodia, however product costs and availability are still unknown.

Author SummaryDengue is one of the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral diseases in the world, is caused by bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes, and can sometimes lead to death. Cambodia has one of the highest per-capita incidence rates in Asia. Without a cure or routinely available efficacious vaccine, dengue control relies largely on reduction and avoidance of mosquitoes. In Cambodia, dengue mosquito control activities are focused on larviciding with temephos and pyrethroid based adulticide sprays to which Aedes have been shown to be increasingly resistant. This study was designed to evaluate novel biological vector control tools (guppy fish and a controlled release larvicidal matrix) utilizing an integrated vector management approach with community-based methods tailored to the local context. The results indicate that the tools resulted in a statistically significant reduction in immature and adult Aedes mosquito density. The interventions were accepted by and communities were willing to pay for them. The results suggest guppies are an ideal vector control tool as long as the benefits outweigh any potential environmental concerns.

10.1101/2020.07.08.194019,Unlocking the Predictive Power of Heterogeneous Data to Build an Operational Dengue Forecasting System,"Predicting an infectious disease can help reduce its impact by advising public health interventions and personal preventive measures. While availability of heterogeneous data streams and sensors such as satellite imagery and the Internet have increased the opportunity to indirectly measure, understand, and predict global dynamics, the data may be prohibitively large and/or require intensive data management while also requiring subject matter experts to properly exploit the data sources (e.g., deriving features from fundamentally different data sets). Few efforts have quantitatively assessed the predictive benefit of novel data streams in comparison to more traditional data sources, especially at fine spatio-temporal resolutions. We have combined multiple traditional and non-traditional data streams (satellite imagery, Internet, weather, census, and clinical surveillance data) and assessed their combined ability to predict dengue in Brazils 27 states on a weekly and yearly basis over seven years. For each state, we nowcast dengue based on several time series models, which vary in complexity and inclusion of exogenous data. We also predict yearly cumulative risk by municipality and state. The top-performing model and utility of predictive data varies by state, implying that forecasting and nowcasting efforts in the future may be made more robust by and benefit from the use of multiple data streams and models. One size does not fit all, particularly when considering state-level predictions as opposed to the whole country.

10.1101/2020.05.27.119537,Competition delays multi-drug resistance evolution during combination therapy,"Combination therapies have shown remarkable success in preventing the evolution of resistance to multiple drugs, including HIV, tuberculosis, and cancer. Nevertheless, the rise in drug resistance still remains an important challenge. The capability to accurately predict the emergence of resistance, either to one or multiple drugs, may help to improve treatment options. Existing theoretical approaches often focus on exponential growth laws, which may not be realistic when scarce resources and competition limit growth. In this work, we study the emergence of single and double drug resistance in a model of combination therapy of two drugs. The model describes a sensitive strain, two types of single-resistant strains, and a double-resistant strain. We compare the probability that resistance emerges for three growth laws: exponential growth, logistic growth without competition between strains, and logistic growth with competition between strains. Using mathematical estimates and numerical simulations, we show that between-strain competition only affects the emergence of single resistance when resources are scarce. In contrast, the probability of double resistance is affected by between-strain competition over a wider space of resource availability. This indicates that competition between different resistant strains may be pertinent to identifying strategies for suppressing drug resistance, and that exponential models may overestimate the emergence of resistance to multiple drugs. A by-product of our work is an efficient strategy to evaluate probabilities of single and double resistance in models with multiple sequential mutations. This may be useful for a range of other problems in which the probability of resistance is of interest.",2020-05-30,evolutionary biology,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,combination therapies have shown remarkable success in preventing the evolution of resistance to multiple drugs including hiv tuberculosis and cancer nevertheless the rise in drug resistance still remains an important challenge the capability to accurately predict the emergence of resistance either to one or multiple drugs may help to improve treatment options existing theoretical approaches often focus on exponential growth laws which may not be realistic when scarce resources and competition limit growth in this work we study the emergence of single and double drug resistance in a model of combination therapy of two drugs the model describes a sensitive strain two types of single resistant strains and a double resistant strain we compare the probability that resistance emerges for three growth laws exponential growth logistic growth without competition between strains and logistic growth with competition between strains using mathematical estimates and numerical simulations we show that between strain competition only affects the emergence of single resistance when resources are scarce in contrast the probability of double resistance is affected by between strain competition over a wider space of resource availability this indicates that competition between different resistant strains may be pertinent to identifying strategies for suppressing drug resistance and that exponential models may overestimate the emergence of resistance to multiple drugs a by product of our work is an efficient strategy to evaluate probabilities of single and double resistance in models with multiple sequential mutations this may be useful for a range of other problems in which the probability of resistance is of interest,combination therapy show remarkable success prevent evolution resistance multiple drug include hiv tuberculosis cancer nevertheless rise drug resistance still remain important challenge capability accurately predict emergence resistance either one multiple drug may help improve treatment option exist theoretical approach often focus exponential growth law may realistic scarce resource competition limit growth work study emergence single double drug resistance model combination therapy two drug model describe sensitive strain two type single resistant strain double resistant strain compare probability resistance emerge three growth law exponential growth logistic growth without competition strain logistic growth competition strain use mathematical estimate numerical simulation show strain competition affect emergence single resistance resource scarce contrast probability double resistance affect strain competition wide space resource availability indicate competition different resistant strain may pertinent identify strategy suppress drug resistance exponential model may overestimate emergence resistance multiple drug product work efficient strategy evaluate probability single double resistance model multiple sequential mutation may useful range problem probability resistance interest

Formation of T cell-bounded hypoxic granuloma is a host immune defence for containing infected Mtb-macrophages. Our study exploits the mechanistic pathway of Mtb-induced HIF1A silencing by the antisense lncRNA-HIF1A-AS2 in T cells. Computational analysis of in-vitro T-cell stimulation assays in progressors (n=119) versus non-progressor (n=221) tuberculosis patients revealed the role of lncRNA mediated disruption of hypoxia adaptation pathways in progressors. We found 291 upregulated and 227 downregulated DE lncRNAs that were correlated at mRNA level with HIF1A and HILPDA which are major players in hypoxia response. We also report novel lncRNA-AC010655 (AC010655.4 and AC010655.2) in cis with HILPDA, both of which contain binding sites for the BARX2 transcription factor, thus indicating a mechanistic role. Detailed comparison of infection with antigenic stimulation showed a non-random enrichment of lncRNAs in the cytoplasmic fraction of the cell in TB progressors. The lack of this pattern in non-progressors replicates indicates the hijacking of the lncRNA dynamics by Mtb. The in-vitro manifestation of this response in the absence of granuloma indicates pre-programmed host-pathogen interaction between T-cells and Mtb regulated through lncRNAs, thus tipping this balance towards progression or containment of Mtb. Finally, we trained multiple machine learning classifiers for reliable prediction of latent to the active progression of patients, yielding a model to guide aggressive treatment.",2020-04-13,bioinformatics,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,cytosolic functions of long non coding rnas including mrna translation masking and sponging are major regulators of biological pathways formation of t cell bounded hypoxic granuloma is a host immune defence for containing infected mtb macrophages our study exploits the mechanistic pathway of mtb induced hif a silencing by the antisense lncrna hif a as in t cells computational analysis of in vitro t cell stimulation assays in progressors n versus non progressor n tuberculosis patients revealed the role of lncrna mediated disruption of hypoxia adaptation pathways in progressors we found upregulated and downregulated de lncrnas that were correlated at mrna level with hif a and hilpda which are major players in hypoxia response we also report novel lncrna ac ac and ac in cis with hilpda both of which contain binding sites for the barx transcription factor thus indicating a mechanistic role detailed comparison of infection with antigenic stimulation showed a non random enrichment of lncrnas in the cytoplasmic fraction of the cell in tb progressors the lack of this pattern in non progressors replicates indicates the hijacking of the lncrna dynamics by mtb the in vitro manifestation of this response in the absence of granuloma indicates pre programmed host pathogen interaction between t cells and mtb regulated through lncrnas thus tipping this balance towards progression or containment of mtb finally we trained multiple machine learning classifiers for reliable prediction of latent to the active progression of patients yielding a model to guide aggressive treatment,cytosolic function long non code rnas include mrna translation mask sponge major regulator biological pathway formation cell bound hypoxic granuloma host immune defence contain infected mtb macrophage study exploit mechanistic pathway mtb induce hif silence antisense lncrna hif cell computational analysis vitro cell stimulation assay progressor versus non progressor tuberculosis patient reveal role lncrna mediate disruption hypoxia adaptation pathway progressor find upregulated downregulate lncrnas correlate mrna level hif hilpda major player hypoxia response also report novel lncrna cis hilpda contain bind site barx transcription factor thus indicate mechanistic role detail comparison infection antigenic stimulation show non random enrichment lncrnas cytoplasmic fraction cell progressor lack pattern non progressor replicate indicate hijacking lncrna dynamic mtb vitro manifestation response absence granuloma indicate pre program host pathogen interaction cell mtb regulated lncrnas thus tip balance towards progression containment mtb finally train multiple machine learning classifier reliable prediction latent active progression patient yield model guide aggressive treatment
10.1101/2020.03.31.019323,A trimeric autotransporter enhances biofilm cohesiveness in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis but not in Yersinia pestis,"Cohesion of biofilms made by Yersinia pestis and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Yptb) has been attributed solely to an extracellular polysaccharide matrix encoded by the hms genes (Hms-ECM). However, mutations in the Yptb BarA/UvrY/CsrB regulatory cascade enhance biofilm stability without dramatically increasing Hms-ECM production. We found that treatment with proteinase K enzyme effectively destabilized Yptb csrB mutant biofilms, suggesting that cell-cell interactions might be mediated by protein adhesins or extracellular matrix proteins. We identified an uncharacterized trimeric autotransporter lipoprotein (YPTB2394), repressed by csrB, which has been referred to as YadE. Biofilms made by a {Delta}yadE mutant strain were extremely sensitive to mechanical disruption. Overexpression of yadE in wild-type Yptb increased biofilm cohesion, similar to biofilms made by csrB or uvrY mutants. We found that the Rcs signaling cascade, which represses Hms-ECM production, activated expression of yadE. The yadE gene appears to be functional in Yptb but is a pseudogene in modern Y. pestis strains. Expression of functional yadE in Y. pestis KIM6+ altered the production of Hms-ECM and weakened biofilms made by these bacteria. This suggests that although the YadE autotransporter protein increases Yptb biofilm stability, it may be incompatible with Hms-ECM production that is essential for Y. pestis biofilm production in fleas. Inactivation of yadE in Y. pestis may be another instance of selective gene loss in the evolution of flea-borne transmission by this species.

IMPORTANCEThe evolution of Yersinia pestis from its Y. pseudotuberculosis (Yptb) ancestor involved gene acquisition and gene losses, leading to differences in biofilm production. Characterizing the unique biofilm features of both species may provide better understanding of how each adapts to its specific niches. This study identifies a trimeric autotransporter YadE that promotes biofilm stability of Yptb but which has been inactivated in Y. pestis, likely because it is not compatible with Hms polysaccharide that is crucial for biofilms inside fleas. We also reveal that the Rcs signaling cascade, which represses Hms expression in Y. pestis, activates YadE in Yptb. The ability of Yptb to use polysaccharide or YadE protein for cell-cell adhesion may help it produce biofilms in different environments.",2020-04-01,microbiology,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,cohesion of biofilms made by yersinia pestis and yersinia pseudotuberculosis yptb has been attributed solely to an extracellular polysaccharide matrix encoded by the hms genes hms ecm however mutations in the yptb bara uvry csrb regulatory cascade enhance biofilm stability without dramatically increasing hms ecm production we found that treatment with proteinase k enzyme effectively destabilized yptb csrb mutant biofilms suggesting that cell cell interactions might be mediated by protein adhesins or extracellular matrix proteins we identified an uncharacterized trimeric autotransporter lipoprotein yptb repressed by csrb which has been referred to as yade biofilms made by a delta yade mutant strain were extremely sensitive to mechanical disruption overexpression of yade in wild type yptb increased biofilm cohesion similar to biofilms made by csrb or uvry mutants we found that the rcs signaling cascade which represses hms ecm production activated expression of yade the yade gene appears to be functional in yptb but is a pseudogene in modern y pestis strains expression of functional yade in y pestis kim altered the production of hms ecm and weakened biofilms made by these bacteria this suggests that although the yade autotransporter protein increases yptb biofilm stability it may be incompatible with hms ecm production that is essential for y pestis biofilm production in fleas inactivation of yade in y pestis may be another instance of selective gene loss in the evolution of flea borne transmission by this species importancethe evolution of yersinia pestis from its y pseudotuberculosis yptb ancestor involved gene acquisition and gene losses leading to differences in biofilm production characterizing the unique biofilm features of both species may provide better understanding of how each adapts to its specific niches this study identifies a trimeric autotransporter yade that promotes biofilm stability of yptb but which has been inactivated in y pestis likely because it is not compatible with hms polysaccharide that is crucial for biofilms inside fleas we also reveal that the rcs signaling cascade which represses hms expression in y pestis activates yade in yptb the ability of yptb to use polysaccharide or yade protein for cell cell adhesion may help it produce biofilms in different environments,cohesion biofilm make yersinia pestis yersinia pseudotuberculosis yptb attribute solely extracellular polysaccharide matrix encode hms gene hms ecm however mutation yptb bara uvry csrb regulatory cascade enhance biofilm stability without dramatically increase hms ecm production find treatment proteinase enzyme effectively destabilize yptb csrb mutant biofilm suggest cell cell interaction might mediate protein adhesin extracellular matrix protein identify uncharacterized trimeric autotransporter lipoprotein yptb repress csrb refer yade biofilm make delta yade mutant strain extremely sensitive mechanical disruption overexpression yade wild type yptb increase biofilm cohesion similar biofilm make csrb uvry mutant find rcs signal cascade represse hms ecm production activate expression yade yade gene appear functional yptb pseudogene modern pestis strain expression functional yade pestis kim alter production hms ecm weaken biofilm make bacteria suggest although yade autotransporter protein increase yptb biofilm stability may incompatible hms ecm production essential pestis biofilm production flea inactivation yade pestis may another instance selective gene loss evolution flea bear transmission specie importancethe evolution yersinia pestis pseudotuberculosis yptb ancestor involve gene acquisition gene loss lead difference biofilm production characterize unique biofilm feature specie may provide well understand adapt specific niche study identifie trimeric autotransporter yade promote biofilm stability yptb inactivated pestis likely compatible hms polysaccharide crucial biofilm inside flea also reveal rcs signal cascade represse hms expression pestis activate yade yptb ability yptb use polysaccharide yade protein cell cell adhesion may help produce biofilm different environment
10.1101/721100,Anti-inflammatory role of curcumin in Lipopolysaccharide treated A549 cells at global proteome level and on mycobacterial infection,"A diet derived agent Curcumin (Diferuloylmethane), demonstrated its clinical application in inflammation, infection and cancer conditions. Nevertheless, its impact on the proteome of epithelial cells of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is yet to be explored. We employed a stable isotope labeling method for cell culture (SILAC) based relative quantitative proteomics and informatics analysis to comprehend global proteome change in A549 cells treated with curcumin and/or Lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Pretreated A549 cells were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strain to monitor bacterial load. With exposure to curcumin and LPS, out of the 1492 identified proteins, 305 and 346 proteins showed deregulation respectively. The expression of BID and AIFM1 mitochondrial proteins which play critical role in apoptotic pathway were deregulated in curcumin treated cells. Higher mitochondria intensity was observed in curcumin treated A549 cells than LPS treatment. Simultaneous treatment of curcumin and LPS neutralized the effect of LPS. Curcumin and/or LPS pretreated A549 cells infected with H37Rv, showed successful bacterial internalization.

10.1101/2020.03.23.002931,"Ultra-Low-Cost Integrated Silicon-based Transducer for On-Site, Genetic Detection of Pathogens","Rapid screening and low-cost diagnosis play a crucial role in choosing the correct course of intervention e.g., drug therapy, quarantine, no action etc. when dealing with highly infectious pathogens. This is especially important if the disease-causing agent has no effective treatment, such as the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (the pathogen causing COVID-19), and shows no or similar symptoms to other common infections. We report a silicon-based integrated Point-of-Need (PoN) transducer (TriSilix) that can chemically-amplify and detect pathogen-specific sequences of nucleic acids (NA) quantitatively in real-time. Unlike other silicon-based technologies, TriSilix can be produced at wafer-scale in a standard laboratory; we have developed a series of methodologies based on metal-assisted chemical (wet) etching, electroplating, thermal bonding and laser-cutting to enable a cleanroom-free low-cost fabrication that does not require processing in an advanced semiconductor foundry. TriSilix is, therefore, resilient to disruptions in the global supply chain as the devices can be produced anywhere in the world. To create an ultra-low-cost device, the architecture proposed exploits the intrinsic properties of silicon and integrates three modes of operation in a single chip: i) electrical (Joule) heater, ii) temperature sensor (i.e. thermistor) with a negative temperature coefficient that can provide the precise temperature of the sample solution during reaction and iii) electrochemical sensor for detecting target NA. Using TriSilix, the sample solution can be maintained at a single, specific temperature (needed for isothermal amplification of NA such as Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) or cycled between different temperatures (with a precision of {+/-}1.3{degrees}C) for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) while the exact concentration of amplicons is measured quantitatively and in real-time electrochemically. A single 4-inch Si wafer yields 37 TriSilix chips of 10x10x0.65 mm in size and can be produced in 7 hours, costing ~US $0.35 per device. The system is operated digitally, portable and low power - capable of running up to 35 tests with a 4000 mAh battery (a typical battery capacity of a modern smartphone). We were able to quantitatively detect a 563-bp fragment (Insertion Sequence IS900) of the genomic DNA of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (extracted from cultured field samples) through PCR in real-time with a Limit-of-Detection of 20 fg, equivalent to a single bacterium, at the 30th cycle.

This folding determines the functional properties of RNA molecules and possibly having a critical role during the synthesis as well. This functioning includes the characterized properties of riboswitches and ribozymes as well, which is significant when the transcription rate is comparable to the cellular environment. This study aims to discover a novel non-coding region that is important in the genetic expression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In this work, we identified a novel non-coding element of polyphosphate glucokinase (ppgk) gene that undergoes cleavage activity during the transcriptional process in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We revealed that cleavage occurs within the nascent RNA, and the resultant cleaved 3RNA fragment carries the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence and expression platform. Site-specific mutations provide a strong correlation between the disruption of cleavage activity and expression of ppgk gene. We concluded that co-transcriptional processing at the noncoding region as the required mechanism for ppgk expression that remains constitutive within the bacterial environment. The underlying reason for ppgk mRNA processing and expression is correlated because the non-coding counterpart adopts a hairpin domain that sequesters ribosomal binding site. Thus, the mRNA processing at the immediate upstream of Shine-Dalgarno sequence is required to prevent this sequestration and subsequent expression as well.

The biosynthesis of CoA is performed in five steps, with the second and third steps being catalysed in the vast majority of prokaryotes, including M. tuberculosis, by a single bifunctional protein, CoaBC. Depletion of CoaBC was found to be bactericidal in M. tuberculosis. Here we report the first structure of a full-length CoaBC, from the model organism Mycobacterium smegmatis, describe how it is organised as a dodecamer and regulated by CoA thioesters.

10.1101/2020.03.11.987933,Exact mapping of Illumina blind spots in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome reveals platform-wide and workflow-specific biases,"Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is fundamental to M. tuberculosis basic research and many clinical applications. Coverage across Illumina-sequenced M. tuberculosis genomes is known to vary with sequence context, but this bias is poorly characterized. Here, through a novel application of phylogenomics that distinguishes genuine coverage bias from deletions, we discern Illumina ""blind spots"" in the M. tuberculosis reference genome for seven sequencing workflows. We find blind spots to be widespread, affecting 529 genes, and provide their exact coordinates, enabling salvage of unaffected regions. Fifty-seven PE/PPE genes (the primary families assumed to exhibit Illumina bias) lack blind spots entirely, while remaining PE/PPE genes account for 55.1% of blind spots. Surprisingly, we find coverage bias persists in homopolymers as short as 6 bp, shorter tracts than previously reported. While GC-rich regions challenge all Illumina sequencing workflows, a modified Nextera library preparation that amplifies DNA with a high-fidelity polymerase markedly attenuates coverage bias in GC-rich and homopolymeric sequences, expanding the ""Illumina-sequencable"" genome. Through these findings, and by defining workflow-specific exclusion criteria, we spotlight effective strategies for handling bias in M. tuberculosis Illumina WGS.

10.1101/2020.04.23.057067,The molecular basis for a temperature-sensitive Mycobacterium smegmatis glgE mutant,"BackgroundThe bacterial GlgE pathway is the third known route to glycogen and is the only one present in mycobacteria. It contributes to the virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The involvement of GlgE in glycogen biosynthesis was discovered twenty years ago when the phenotype of a temperature-sensitive Mycobacterium smegmatis mutation was rescued by the glgE gene. The evidence at the time suggested glgE coded for a glucanase responsible for the hydrolysis of glycogen, in stark contrast with recent evidence showing GlgE to be a polymerase responsible for its biosynthesis.

MethodsWe reconstructed and examined the temperature-sensitive mutant and characterised the mutated GlgE enzyme.

ResultsThe mutant strain accumulated the substrate for GlgE, -maltose-1-phosphate, at the non-permissive temperature. The glycogen assay used in the original study was shown to give a false positive result with -maltose-1-phosphate. The accumulation of -maltose-1-phosphate was due to the lowering of the kcat of GlgE as well as a loss of stability 42 {o}C. The reported rescue of the phenotype by GarA could potentially involve an interaction with GlgE, but none was detected.

ConclusionsWe have been able to reconcile apparently contradictory observations and shed light on the basis for the phenotype of the temperature-sensitive mutation.

Sequencing the whole genome of the pathogen(s) in a clinical sample offers one way to improve clinical microbiology diagnostic services, and has already been adopted for tuberculosis in some countries. A key weakness of a genetics clinical microbiology is it cannot return a result for rare or novel genetic variants and therefore predictive methods are required. Non-synonymous mutations in the S. aureus dfrB gene can be successfully classified as either conferring resistance (or not) by calculating their effect on the binding free energy of the antibiotic, trimethoprim.

10.1101/860288,Developing synergistic drug combinations to restore antibiotic sensitivity in drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading global cause of mortality owing to an infectious agent, accounting for almost one-third of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) deaths annually. We aimed to identify synergistic anti-TB drug combinations with the capacity to restore therapeutic efficacy against drug-resistant mutants of the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We investigated combinations containing the known translational inhibitors, spectinomycin (SPT) and fusidic acid (FA), or the phenothiazine, chlorpromazine (CPZ), which disrupts mycobacterial energy metabolism. Potentiation of whole-cell drug efficacy was observed in SPT-CPZ combinations. This effect was lost against an M. tuberculosis mutant lacking the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) efflux pump, Rv1258c. Notably, the SPT-CPZ combination restored SPT efficacy against an SPT-resistant mutant carrying a g1379t point mutation in rrs, encoding the mycobacterial 16S ribosomal RNA. Combinations of SPT with FA, which targets the mycobacterial elongation factor G, exhibited potentiating activity against wild-type M. tuberculosis. Moreover, this combination produced a marginal potentiating effect against both FA-monoresistant and SPT-monoresistant mutants. Finally, combining SPT with the frontline anti-TB agents, rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid, resulted in enhanced activity in vitro and ex vivo against both drug-susceptible M. tuberculosis and a RIF-monoresistant rpoB S531L mutant.These results support the utility of novel potentiating drug combinations in restoring antibiotic susceptibility of M. tuberculosis strains carrying genetic resistance to any one of the partner compounds.",2020-12-08,microbiology,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,tuberculosis tb is a leading global cause of mortality owing to an infectious agent accounting for almost one third of antimicrobial resistance amr deaths annually we aimed to identify synergistic anti tb drug combinations with the capacity to restore therapeutic efficacy against drug resistant mutants of the causative agent mycobacterium tuberculosis we investigated combinations containing the known translational inhibitors spectinomycin spt and fusidic acid fa or the phenothiazine chlorpromazine cpz which disrupts mycobacterial energy metabolism potentiation of whole cell drug efficacy was observed in spt cpz combinations this effect was lost against an m tuberculosis mutant lacking the major facilitator superfamily mfs efflux pump rv c notably the spt cpz combination restored spt efficacy against an spt resistant mutant carrying a g t point mutation in rrs encoding the mycobacterial s ribosomal rna combinations of spt with fa which targets the mycobacterial elongation factor g exhibited potentiating activity against wild type m tuberculosis moreover this combination produced a marginal potentiating effect against both fa monoresistant and spt monoresistant mutants finally combining spt with the frontline anti tb agents rifampicin rif and isoniazid resulted in enhanced activity in vitro and ex vivo against both drug susceptible m tuberculosis and a rif monoresistant rpob s l mutant these results support the utility of novel potentiating drug combinations in restoring antibiotic susceptibility of m tuberculosis strains carrying genetic resistance to any one of the partner compounds,tuberculosis lead global cause mortality owe infectious agent account almost one third antimicrobial resistance amr death annually aim identify synergistic anti drug combination capacity restore therapeutic efficacy drug resistant mutant causative agent mycobacterium tuberculosis investigate combination contain know translational inhibitor spectinomycin spt fusidic acid phenothiazine chlorpromazine cpz disrupt mycobacterial energy metabolism potentiation whole cell drug efficacy observe spt cpz combination effect lose tuberculosis mutant lack major facilitator superfamily mfs efflux pump notably spt cpz combination restore spt efficacy spt resistant mutant carry point mutation rrs encode mycobacterial ribosomal rna combination spt target mycobacterial elongation factor exhibit potentiate activity wild type tuberculosis moreover combination produce marginal potentiating effect monoresistant spt monoresistant mutant finally combine spt frontline anti agent rifampicin rif isoniazid result enhance activity vitro vivo drug susceptible tuberculosis rif monoresistant rpob mutant result support utility novel potentiate drug combination restore antibiotic susceptibility tuberculosis strain carry genetic resistance one partner compound

FasR is a two-domain transcriptional activator that belongs to the TetR family of regulators, and plays a central role in mycobacterial long-chain fatty acyl-CoA sensing and lipid biosynthesis regulation. We now disclose crystal structures of M. tuberculosis FasR in complex with acyl effector ligands and with DNA, uncovering its sensory and switching mechanisms. A long tunnel traverses the entire effector-binding domain, enabling long fatty acyl effectors to bind. Only when the tunnel is entirely occupied, the protein dimer adopts a rigid configuration, with its DNA-binding domains in an open state that leads to DNA dissociation. Structure-guided point-mutations further support this effector-dependent mechanism. The protein-folding hydrophobic core, connecting the two domains, is completed by the effector ligand into a continuous spine, explaining the allosteric flexible-to-ordered transition. The transmission spine is conserved in all TetR-like transcription factors, offering new opportunities for anti-tuberculosis drug discovery.",2020-03-06,microbiology,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,mycobacterium tuberculosis is a pathogen with a unique cell envelope including very long fatty acids implicated in bacterial resistance and host immune modulation fasr is a two domain transcriptional activator that belongs to the tetr family of regulators and plays a central role in mycobacterial long chain fatty acyl coa sensing and lipid biosynthesis regulation we now disclose crystal structures of m tuberculosis fasr in complex with acyl effector ligands and with dna uncovering its sensory and switching mechanisms a long tunnel traverses the entire effector binding domain enabling long fatty acyl effectors to bind only when the tunnel is entirely occupied the protein dimer adopts a rigid configuration with its dna binding domains in an open state that leads to dna dissociation structure guided point mutations further support this effector dependent mechanism the protein folding hydrophobic core connecting the two domains is completed by the effector ligand into a continuous spine explaining the allosteric flexible to ordered transition the transmission spine is conserved in all tetr like transcription factors offering new opportunities for anti tuberculosis drug discovery,mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogen unique cell envelope include long fatty acid implicate bacterial resistance host immune modulation fasr two domain transcriptional activator belong tetr family regulator play central role mycobacterial long chain fatty acyl coa sense lipid biosynthesis regulation disclose crystal structure tuberculosis fasr complex acyl effector ligand dna uncover sensory switch mechanism long tunnel traverse entire effector bind domain enable long fatty acyl effector bind tunnel entirely occupy protein dimer adopt rigid configuration dna bind domain open state lead dna dissociation structure guide point mutation support effector dependent mechanism protein fold hydrophobic core connect two domain complete effector ligand continuous spine explain allosteric flexible order transition transmission spine conserve tetr like transcription factor offer new opportunity anti tuberculosis drug discovery
10.1101/2020.02.14.943365,Network analysis identifies regulators of lineage-specific phenotypes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) complex includes ten phylogenetically distinct human-adapted lineages with varying geographical distributions and pathogenicity. Lineage 1 (L1) is associated with low virulence, while Lineage 2 (L2) is linked to hyper-virulence, increased transmission, and drug resistance. We performed multi-layer comparative analyses integrating whole-genome sequencing with quantitative transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of a panel of L1 and L2 clinical strains, each grown under two in vitro conditions. Our data revealed variable correlations between transcript and protein levels across strains and gene categories, indicating lineage-specific post-translational regulation. Transcriptional and translational differences scaled with phylogenetic distance, with one in three SNPs on average leading to gene expression changes. A newly developed genome-scale transcriptional regulatory model identified master transcription factors--closely linked to the sigma factor network--whose targets were differentially expressed between L1 and L2. Notably, DosR proteins showed higher basal levels and a stronger nitric oxide (NO) response in L2. Time-course validation using an Rv1985c induction and wild-type H37Rv under hypoxia and reaeration confirmed the role of Rv1985c in the differentially expressed genes between L1 and L2. These findings suggest that limited genetic variation can translate into significant phenotypic differences via differential regulation of key transcriptional networks.

10.1101/2020.01.15.907535,Post-transcriptional modulation of the SigF regulon in Mycobacterium smegmatis by the PhoH2 toxin-antitoxin.,"PhoH2 proteins are highly conserved across bacteria and archaea yet their biological function is poorly characterised. We examined the growth profiles of Mycobacterium smegmatis strains mc2155 and mc2155 {Delta}phoH2 and observed the same growth profile and growth rate in a variety of conditions. In light of the comparable growth rates, we used RNAseq to provide a snapshot of the differences between the transcriptomes of M. smegmatis mc2155 and M. smegmatis mc2155 {Delta}phoH2 during normal growth. At 48 hours, elevated expression of the sigF regulon and its predicted regulatory cascade was observed in{Delta} phoH2 relative to wild type. In biochemical assays, PhoH2 showed specific activity toward sigF mRNA insinuating a role of PhoH2 in modulating the pool of sigF mRNA in the cell during normal growth, adding further complexity to the repertoire of reported mechanisms of post-translational regulation. Multiple copies of the preferred target site of PhoH2 were identified in loops of the sigF mRNA structure, leading us to propose a mechanism for the activity of PhoH2 that is initiated after assembly on specific single-stranded loops of RNA. We hypothesise that PhoH2 is a toxin-antitoxin that contributes to the regulation of SigF at a post-transcriptional level through targeted activity on sigF mRNA. This work presents the first evidence for post-transcriptional regulation of SigF along with the biological function of PhoH2 from M. smegmatis.

10.1101/2020.05.27.120451,Characterization of genomic variants associated with resistance to bedaquiline and delamanid in naïve Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical strains,"The role of genetic mutations in genes associated to phenotypic resistance to bedaquiline (BDQ) and delamanid (DLM) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBc) strains is poorly understood. However, a clear understanding of the role of each genetic variant is crucial to guide the development of molecular-based drug susceptibility testing (DST). In this work, we analysed all mutations in candidate genomic regions associated with BDQ- and DLM-resistant phenotypes using a whole genome sequencing (WGS) dataset from a collection of 4795 MTBc clinical isolates from six high-burden countries of tuberculosis (TB). From WGS analysis, we identified 61 and 158 unique mutations in genomic regions potentially involved in BDQ- and DLM-resistant phenotypes, respectively. Importantly, all strains were isolated from patients who likely have never been exposed to the medicines. In order to characterize the role of mutations, we performed an energetic in silico analysis to evaluate their effect in the available protein structures Ddn (DLM), Fgd1 (DLM) and Rv0678 (BDQ), and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays on a subset of MTBc strains carrying mutations to assess their phenotypic effect. The combination of structural protein information and phenotypic data allowed for cataloging the mutations clearly associated with resistance to BDQ (n= 4) and DLM (n= 35), as well as about a hundred genetic variants without any correlation with resistance. Importantly, these results show that both BDQ and DLM resistance-related mutations are diverse and distributed across the entire region of each gene target, which is of critical importance to the development of comprehensive molecular diagnostic tools.

ImportancePhenotypic drug susceptibility tests (DST) are too slow to provide an early indication of drug susceptibility status at the time of treatment initiation and very demanding in terms of specimens handling and biosafety. The development of molecular assays to detect resistance to bedaquiline (BDQ) and delamanid (DLM) requires accurate categorization of genetic variants according to their association with phenotypic resistance. We have evaluated a large multi-country set of clinical isolates to identify mutations associated with increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and used an in silico protein structure analysis to further unravel the potential role of these mutations in drug resistance mechanisms. The results of this study are an important source of information for the development of molecular diagnostic tests to improve the provision of appropriate treatment and care to TB patients.",2020-06-01,microbiology,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,the role of genetic mutations in genes associated to phenotypic resistance to bedaquiline bdq and delamanid dlm in mycobacterium tuberculosis complex mtbc strains is poorly understood however a clear understanding of the role of each genetic variant is crucial to guide the development of molecular based drug susceptibility testing dst in this work we analysed all mutations in candidate genomic regions associated with bdq and dlm resistant phenotypes using a whole genome sequencing wgs dataset from a collection of mtbc clinical isolates from six high burden countries of tuberculosis tb from wgs analysis we identified and unique mutations in genomic regions potentially involved in bdq and dlm resistant phenotypes respectively importantly all strains were isolated from patients who likely have never been exposed to the medicines in order to characterize the role of mutations we performed an energetic in silico analysis to evaluate their effect in the available protein structures ddn dlm fgd dlm and rv bdq and minimum inhibitory concentration mic assays on a subset of mtbc strains carrying mutations to assess their phenotypic effect the combination of structural protein information and phenotypic data allowed for cataloging the mutations clearly associated with resistance to bdq n and dlm n as well as about a hundred genetic variants without any correlation with resistance importantly these results show that both bdq and dlm resistance related mutations are diverse and distributed across the entire region of each gene target which is of critical importance to the development of comprehensive molecular diagnostic tools importancephenotypic drug susceptibility tests dst are too slow to provide an early indication of drug susceptibility status at the time of treatment initiation and very demanding in terms of specimens handling and biosafety the development of molecular assays to detect resistance to bedaquiline bdq and delamanid dlm requires accurate categorization of genetic variants according to their association with phenotypic resistance we have evaluated a large multi country set of clinical isolates to identify mutations associated with increased minimum inhibitory concentrations mics and used an in silico protein structure analysis to further unravel the potential role of these mutations in drug resistance mechanisms the results of this study are an important source of information for the development of molecular diagnostic tests to improve the provision of appropriate treatment and care to tb patients,role genetic mutation gene associate phenotypic resistance bedaquiline bdq delamanid dlm mycobacterium tuberculosis complex mtbc strain poorly understand however clear understand role genetic variant crucial guide development molecular base drug susceptibility testing dst work analyse mutation candidate genomic region associate bdq dlm resistant phenotype use whole genome sequence wgs dataset collection mtbc clinical isolate six high burden country tuberculosis wgs analysis identify unique mutation genomic region potentially involve bdq dlm resistant phenotype respectively importantly strain isolated patient likely never expose medicine order characterize role mutation perform energetic silico analysis evaluate effect available protein structure ddn dlm fgd dlm bdq minimum inhibitory concentration mic assay subset mtbc strain carry mutation assess phenotypic effect combination structural protein information phenotypic datum allow catalog mutation clearly associate resistance bdq dlm well hundred genetic variant without correlation resistance importantly result show bdq dlm resistance relate mutation diverse distribute across entire region gene target critical importance development comprehensive molecular diagnostic tool importancephenotypic drug susceptibility test dst slow provide early indication drug susceptibility status time treatment initiation demand term specimen handle biosafety development molecular assay detect resistance bedaquiline bdq delamanid dlm require accurate categorization genetic variant accord association phenotypic resistance evaluate large multi country set clinical isolate identify mutation associate increase minimum inhibitory concentration mic use silico protein structure analysis unravel potential role mutation drug resistance mechanism result study important source information development molecular diagnostic test improve provision appropriate treatment care patient
10.1101/2020.04.13.039222,Subpopulations of stressed Y. pseudotuberculosis preferentially survive doxycycline treatment within host tissues,"Severe systemic bacterial infections result in colonization of deep tissues, which can be very difficult to eliminate with antibiotics. It remains unclear if this is because antibiotics are not reaching inhibitory concentrations within tissues, if subsets of bacteria are less susceptible to antibiotics, or if both contribute to limited treatment efficacy. To determine the concentration of doxycycline (Dox) present within deep tissues following treatment, we generated a fluorescent transcriptional reporter derived from the tet operon to specifically detect intracellular tetracycline exposure at the single bacterial cell level. Dox exposure was detected in the spleen 2 hours after intraperitoneal injection, and by 4 hours post-injection, this treatment resulted in a significant decrease in viable Yersinia pseudotuberculosis in the spleen. Nitric oxide-stressed bacteria preferentially survived treatment, suggesting stress was sufficient to alter Dox susceptibility. Many bacteria (~10%) survived a single dose of Dox, and the antibiotic accumulated at the periphery of microcolonies to growth inhibitory concentrations until 48 hours post-treatment. After this timepoint, antibiotic concentrations decreased and bacterial growth resumed. Dox-treated mice eventually succumbed to the infection, albeit with significantly prolonged survival relative to untreated mice. These results indicate that Dox delivery by intraperitoneal injection results in rapid diffusion of inhibitory concentrations of antibiotic into the spleen, but stressed cells preferentially survive drug treatment, and bacterial growth resumes once drug concentrations decrease. This fluorescent reporter strategy for antibiotic detection could easily be modified to detect the concentration of additional antimicrobial compounds within host tissues following drug administration.

ImportanceBacterial infections are very difficult to treat when bacteria spread into the bloodstream and begin to replicate within deep tissues, such as the spleen. Subsets of bacteria can survive antibiotic treatment, but it remains unclear if this survival is because of limited drug diffusion into tissues, or if something has changed within the bacteria, promoting survival of some bacterial cells. Here, we have developed a fluorescent reporter to detect doxycycline (Dox) diffusion into host tissues, and show that Dox impacts the bacterial population within hours of administration, and inhibits bacterial growth for 48 hours. However, bacterial growth resumes when antibiotic concentrations decrease. Subsets of bacteria, stressed by the host response to infection, survive Dox treatment at a higher rate.

10.1101/2020.03.17.995167,Pan-genome analysis of Mycobacterium africanum: insights to dynamics and evolution,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) consists of seven major lineages with three of them reported to circulate within West Africa: lineage 5 (West African 1) and lineage 6 (West African 2) which are geographically restricted to West Africa and lineage 4 (Euro-American lineage) which is found globally. It is unclear why the West African lineages are not found elsewhere; some hypotheses suggest that it could either be harboured by an animal reservoir which is restricted to West Africa, or strain preference for hosts of West African ethnicity, or inability to compete with other lineages in other locations.

We tested the hypothesis that M. africanum (MAF) might have emigrated out of West Africa but was outcompeted by more virulent strains of M. tuberculosis (MTB).

Whole genome sequences of MTB from Nigeria (n=21), China (n=21) and MAF from Mali (n=24) were retrieved, and a pan-genome analysis was performed after fully annotating these genomes. The outcome of this analysis shows that Lineages 4, 5 and 6 have relatively close pan-genomes whilst lineage 2 has an open pan-genome. We also see a correlation in numbers of some multiple copy core genes and amino acid substitution with lineage specificity that may have contributed to geographical distribution of these lineages.

10.1101/2020.01.08.899369,Nα-acetylation of EsxA is required for mycobacterial cytosolic translocation and virulence,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis virulence factors, EsxA and EsxB, are secreted as a heterodimer (EsxA:B) and play an essential role in mycobacterial phagosomal escape and cytosolic translocation. Current studies support a model that EsxA must dissociate from its chaperon EsxB at low pH in order for EsxA to interact with host membranes. However, the mechanism of the heterodimer separation is not clear. In the present study, we have obtained evidence that the N-acetylation of Thr2 on EsxA, a post-translational modification that is present in mycobacteria, but absent in E. coli, is required for the heterodimer separation. The point mutations at Thr2 without N-acetylation inhibited the heterodimer separation and hence prevented EsxA from interacting with the membranes, which resulted in attenuated mycobacterial cytosolic translocation and virulence.

Genetically determined levels of MBL can modify the risk and clinical characteristics of many infectious diseases. The frequency of MBL2 genotypes exhibits significant population differences. The data on the distribution of MBL2 genotypes among the aborigines of the Russian Arctic territories have not yet been published.

MethodsA total of 880 specimens of dried blood spots of the newborns were genotyped. The newborns represented four populations: Nenets, Dolgan-Nganasans, Mixed aboriginal population, and Russians (Caucasians, Krasnoyarsk). Six polymorphisms of the MBL2 gene were studied: rs11003125, rs7096206, rs7095891, rs5030737, rs1800450, and rs1800451.

ResultsThe frequency of the combined rare O allele (composed of the coding region variants rs5030737, rs1800450, and rs1800451) in the homozygous state was significantly higher in Russians: 10% vs 2% in Nenets and 1% in Dolgan-Nganosans (p<0.001 for Russians vs other populations). The frequency of the high-producing haplotype (HYPA) was 35.4% in the Russian newborns, in keeping with European populations (27-33%); 64% for Nenets and 56% for Dolgan-Nganasans, similar to the estimates obtained for Eskimos and North Amerinds (64-81%).

10.1101/2020.01.28.922765,Insertion and deletion evolution reflects antibiotics selection pressure in a Mycobacterium tuberculosis outbreak.,"In genome evolution, genetic variants are the source of diversity, which natural selection acts upon. Treatment of human tuberculosis (TB) induces a strong selection pressure for the emergence of antibiotic resistance in the infecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains. MTB evolution in response to treatment has been intensively studied and mainly attributed to point substitutions. However, the contribution of insertions and deletions (indels) to MTB genome evolution remains poorly understood. Here, we analyzed a multi-drug resistant MTB outbreak for the presence of high-quality indels and substitutions. We find that indels are significantly enriched in genes conferring antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, we show that indels are inherited during the outbreak and follow a molecular clock with an evolutionary rate of 5.37e-9 indels/site/year, which is 23x lower compared to the substitution rate. Inherited indels may co-occur with substitutions in genes along related biological pathways; examples are iron storage and resistance to second-line antibiotics. This suggests that epistatic interactions between indels and substitutions affect antibiotic resistance and compensatory evolution in MTB.

Author summaryMycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a human pathogen causing millions of deaths every year. Its genome evolution has been intensively characterized through point substitutions, i.e., nucleotide exchanges that are inherited. Additional mutations are short or long insertions and deletions of nucleotides, termed indels. Short indels in genes might change the reading frame and disrupt the gene product. Here we show that antibiotic treatment has a strong impact on indel evolution in an MTB outbreak. Namely, indels occur frequently in genes causing antibiotic resistance upon disruption. Furthermore, we show that the molecular clock, i.e., the temporal emergence of variants over time, holds for short indels in MTB genomes. Finally, we observe that indels may co-occur with substitutions in genes along related biological pathways. These results support the notion that indels are important contributors to MTB evolution. We anticipate that including indels in the analyses of MTB outbreaks will improve our understanding of antibiotic resistance evolution.",2020-01-28,microbiology,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,in genome evolution genetic variants are the source of diversity which natural selection acts upon treatment of human tuberculosis tb induces a strong selection pressure for the emergence of antibiotic resistance in the infecting mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb strains mtb evolution in response to treatment has been intensively studied and mainly attributed to point substitutions however the contribution of insertions and deletions indels to mtb genome evolution remains poorly understood here we analyzed a multi drug resistant mtb outbreak for the presence of high quality indels and substitutions we find that indels are significantly enriched in genes conferring antibiotic resistance furthermore we show that indels are inherited during the outbreak and follow a molecular clock with an evolutionary rate of e indels site year which is x lower compared to the substitution rate inherited indels may co occur with substitutions in genes along related biological pathways examples are iron storage and resistance to second line antibiotics this suggests that epistatic interactions between indels and substitutions affect antibiotic resistance and compensatory evolution in mtb author summarymycobacterium tuberculosis mtb is a human pathogen causing millions of deaths every year its genome evolution has been intensively characterized through point substitutions i e nucleotide exchanges that are inherited additional mutations are short or long insertions and deletions of nucleotides termed indels short indels in genes might change the reading frame and disrupt the gene product here we show that antibiotic treatment has a strong impact on indel evolution in an mtb outbreak namely indels occur frequently in genes causing antibiotic resistance upon disruption furthermore we show that the molecular clock i e the temporal emergence of variants over time holds for short indels in mtb genomes finally we observe that indels may co occur with substitutions in genes along related biological pathways these results support the notion that indels are important contributors to mtb evolution we anticipate that including indels in the analyses of mtb outbreaks will improve our understanding of antibiotic resistance evolution,genome evolution genetic variant source diversity natural selection act upon treatment human tuberculosis induce strong selection pressure emergence antibiotic resistance infect mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb strain mtb evolution response treatment intensively study mainly attribute point substitution however contribution insertion deletion indel mtb genome evolution remain poorly understand analyzed multi drug resistant mtb outbreak presence high quality indel substitution find indel significantly enrich gene confer antibiotic resistance furthermore show indel inherit outbreak follow molecular clock evolutionary rate indel site year low compare substitution rate inherit indel may occur substitution gene along relate biological pathway example iron storage resistance second line antibiotic suggest epistatic interaction indel substitution affect antibiotic resistance compensatory evolution mtb author summarymycobacterium tuberculosis mtb human pathogen cause million death every year genome evolution intensively characterize point substitution nucleotide exchange inherit additional mutation short long insertion deletion nucleotides term indel short indel gene might change read frame disrupt gene product show antibiotic treatment strong impact indel evolution mtb outbreak namely indel occur frequently gene cause antibiotic resistance upon disruption furthermore show molecular clock temporal emergence variant time hold short indel mtb genome finally observe indel may occur substitution gene along relate biological pathway result support notion indel important contributor mtb evolution anticipate include indel analyse mtb outbreak improve understand antibiotic resistance evolution
10.1101/2020.04.26.062331,Artemisia annua and Artemisia afra extracts exhibit strong bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"Ethnopharmacological relevanceEmergence of drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains is a major barrier to tuberculosis (TB) eradication, as it leads to longer treatment regimens and in many cases treatment failure. Thus, there is an urgent need to explore new TB drugs and combinations, in order to shorten TB treatment and improve outcomes. Here, we evaluate the potential of two medicinal plants, Artemisia annua, a natural source of artemisinin (AN), and Artemisia afra, as sources of novel antitubercular agents.

Aim of the studyOur goal was to measure the activity of A. annua and A. afra extracts against Mtb as potential natural and inexpensive therapies for TB treatment, or as sources of compounds that could be further developed into effective treatments.

Materials and MethodsThe minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of A. annua and A. afra dichloromethane extracts were determined, and concentrations above the MICs were used to evaluate their ability to kill Mtb and Mycobacterium abscessus in vitro.

ResultsPrevious studies showed that A. annua and A. afra inhibit Mtb growth. Here, we show for the first time that Artemisia extracts have a strong bactericidal activity against Mtb. The killing effect of A. annua was much stronger than equivalent concentrations of pure AN, suggesting that A. annua extracts kill Mtb through a combination of AN and additional compounds. A. afra, which produces very little AN, displayed bactericidal activity against Mtb that was substantial but weaker than that of A. annua. In addition, we measured the activity of Artemisia extracts against Mycobacterium abscessus.

However, these algorithms often fail to identify ORFs lacking canonical features such as a length of >50 codons or the presence of an upstream Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Here, we use ribosome profiling approaches to identify actively translated ORFs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Most of the ORFs we identify have not been previously described, indicating that the M. tuberculosis transcriptome is pervasively translated. The newly described ORFs are predominantly short, with many encoding proteins of [&le;]50 amino acids. Codon usage of the newly discovered ORFs suggests that most have not been subject to purifying selection, and hence do not contribute to cell fitness. Nevertheless, we identify 90 new ORFs (median length of 52 codons) that bear the hallmarks of purifying selection.

Since its probable biological role has been proposed to be in DNA damage response, which is inflicted by reactive oxygen species (ROS), in the present study, we examined whether Msm Arr influences ROS levels. For this purpose, the levels of the ROS, hydroxyl radical and superoxide, were determined in the mid-log phase (MLP) cells of Msm arr knockout (arr-KO) strain, in comparison to those in the equivalently grown Msm arr+ wild-type (WT) strain. The MLP arr-KO cells generated significantly elevated levels of superoxide and hydroxyl radical, unlike the equivalently grown WT MLP cells. Complementation of arr-KO with arr, but not with empty vector, restored the ROS levels comparable to those in the WT strain. Elevated ROS levels in the arr-KO strain enabled selection of rifampicin-resistant mutants at 10-7 cfu/ml from the rifampicin-unexposed MLP cells of arr-KO, which is one-log10 higher than that for WT cells (10-8). Upon prolonged exposure to rifampicin, the susceptibility, persister formation, generation of elevated levels of hydroxyl radical by the persisters, rifampicin-resister generation frequency of the persisters and regrowth of the rifampicin-resistant mutants from the respective persisters were all comparable between the arr-KO and WT strains. These observations revealed that Arr influences ROS levels in the actively growing M. smegmatis cells but not in the rifampicin-exposed cells. We proposed the probable pathway through which Arr might be influencing ROS levels in the actively growing M. smegmatis cells.

One of the main reasons for this high mortality rate is the evolution of new Mtb strains that are resistant to available antibiotics. Therefore, new therapeutics for TB are in constant demand. Here we report the development of such inhibitors that target two DNA replication enzymes of Mtb, namely DnaG primase and DNA gyrase, which share a conserved TOPRIM fold near the inhibitors binding site. The molecules were developed on the basis of previously reported inhibitors for T7 DNA primase that bind near the TOPRIM fold. In order to improve the physicochemical properties of the molecules as well as their inhibitory effect on primase and gyrase, 49 novel compounds were synthesized as potential drug candidates in three stages of optimization.

However, the automated annotation of prokaryotic genomes is imperfect, and errors due to fragmented assemblies, contamination, diverse gene families and mis-assemblies accumulate over the population, leading to profound consequences when analysing the set of all genes found in a species. Here we introduce Panaroo, a graph based pangenome clustering tool that is able to account for many of the sources of error introduced during the annotation of prokaryotic genome assemblies. We verified our approach through extensive simulations of de novo assemblies using the infinitely many genes model and by analysing a number of publicly available large bacterial genome datasets. Using a highly clonal Mycobacterium tuberculosis dataset as a negative control case, we show that failing to account for annotation errors can lead to pangenome estimates that are dominated by error. We additionally demonstrate the utility of the improved graphical output provided by Panaroo by performing a pan-genome wide association study in Neisseria gonorrhoeae and by analysing gene gain and loss rates across 51 of the major global pneumococcal sequence clusters.

10.1101/2020.02.20.950329,Revisiting the expression signature of pks15/1 unveils regulatory patterns controlling phenolphtiocerol and phenolglycolipid production in pathogenic mycobacteria,"One of the most relevant and exclusive characteristics of mycobacteria is its cell wall, composed by mycolic acids. Amid these are two related families of glycosylated lipids, diphthioceranates and phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) and its variant phenolic glycolipids (PGL). PGL have been associated with cell wall impermeability, phagocytosis, defence against nitrosative and oxidative stress and, supposedly, biofilm formation. In bacteria from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, the biosynthetic pathway of the phenolphthiocerol moiety of PGL depends upon the expression of several genes encoding type I polyketide synthases (PKS), namely ppsA-E and pks15/1 constituting the PDIM + PGL locus, highly conserved in PDIM/PGL-producing strains. Consensus has not been achieved regarding the genetic organization of pks15/1 locus and little effort has been put on the disclosure of its transcriptional signature. Here we explore publicly available datasets of transcriptome data (RNA-seq) from more than 100 experiments in 40 growth conditions to outline the transcriptional structure and signature of pks15/1 and use a differential expression approach to infer the regulatory patterns involving these and related genes. We show that pks1 is highly correlated with fadD22, Rv2949c, lppX, fadD29 and, also, pks6 and pks12, with the first three putatively integrating a polycistronic structure. We evidence dynamic heterogeneity of transcription within the genes involved in phenolphtiocerol and phenolglycolipid production, most exhibiting up-regulation upon acidic pH and antibiotic exposure and down-regulation under hypoxia, dormancy, and low/high iron concentration.

In the present study, we investigate the mechanism of action of one family of hydrophobic lipids, the phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIM/PDIM), major lipid virulence factors. DIM are transferred from the envelope of Mtb to host membranes during infection. Using the polarity-sensitive fluorophore C-Laurdan, we visualized that DIM increase the membrane polarity of a supported lipid bilayer put in contact with mycobacteria, even beyond the site of contact. We observed that DIM activate the complement receptor 3, a predominant receptor for phagocytosis of Mtb by macrophages. DIM also increased the activity of membrane-permeabilizing effectors of Mtb, among which the virulence factor EsxA. This is consistent with previous observations that DIM help Mtb disrupt host cell membranes. Taken together, our data show that transferred DIM spread within the target membrane, remodel lipid organization and increase the activity of host cell receptors and bacterial effectors, diverting in a nonspecific manner host cell functions.

10.1101/691808,Channeling macrophage polarization via selective translation inhibition by rocaglates increases macrophage resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"Macrophages contribute to host immunity and tissue homeostasis via alternative activation programs. M1-like macrophages control intracellular bacterial pathogens and tumor progression. In contrast, M2-like macrophages shape reparative microenvironments that can be conducive for pathogen survival or tumor growth. An imbalance of these macrophages phenotypes may perpetuate sites of chronic unresolved inflammation, such as infectious granulomas and solid tumors.

We have found that plant-derived and synthetic rocaglates sensitize macrophages to low concentrations of the M1-inducing cytokine IFN-gamma and inhibit their responsiveness to IL-4, a prototypical activator of the M2-like phenotype. Treatement of primary macrophages with rocaglates increased their resilience to oxidative stress, stimulated autophagy and killing of intracellular mycobacteria. Thus, rocaglates represent a novel class of immunomodulators that can direct macrophage polarization towards the M1-like phenotype in complex microenvironments associated with hypofunction of type 1 and/or hyperactivation of type 2 immunity, e.g. chronic bacterial infections, allergies and, possibly, certain tumors.",2020-08-31,immunology,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,macrophages contribute to host immunity and tissue homeostasis via alternative activation programs m like macrophages control intracellular bacterial pathogens and tumor progression in contrast m like macrophages shape reparative microenvironments that can be conducive for pathogen survival or tumor growth an imbalance of these macrophages phenotypes may perpetuate sites of chronic unresolved inflammation such as infectious granulomas and solid tumors we have found that plant derived and synthetic rocaglates sensitize macrophages to low concentrations of the m inducing cytokine ifn gamma and inhibit their responsiveness to il a prototypical activator of the m like phenotype treatement of primary macrophages with rocaglates increased their resilience to oxidative stress stimulated autophagy and killing of intracellular mycobacteria thus rocaglates represent a novel class of immunomodulators that can direct macrophage polarization towards the m like phenotype in complex microenvironments associated with hypofunction of type and or hyperactivation of type immunity e g chronic bacterial infections allergies and possibly certain tumors,macrophage contribute host immunity tissue homeostasis via alternative activation program like macrophage control intracellular bacterial pathogen tumor progression contrast like macrophage shape reparative microenvironment conducive pathogen survival tumor growth imbalance macrophage phenotype may perpetuate site chronic unresolved inflammation infectious granuloma solid tumor find plant derive synthetic rocaglate sensitize macrophage low concentration induce cytokine ifn gamma inhibit responsiveness prototypical activator like phenotype treatement primary macrophage rocaglate increase resilience oxidative stress stimulate autophagy kill intracellular mycobacteria thus rocaglate represent novel class immunomodulator direct macrophage polarization towards like phenotype complex microenvironment associate hypofunction type hyperactivation type immunity chronic bacterial infection allergie possibly certain tumor

The role of MAIT cells within granulomas and other sites of Mtb infection is relatively unknown. Furthermore, how HIV/SIV infection might impair MAIT cells at the sites of Mtb infection has not been determined. Using a Mauritian cynomolgus macaque (MCM) model system, we phenotyped MAIT cells in the peripheral blood and BAL prior to and during infection with SIVmac239. To characterize the role of MAIT cells within granulomas, SIV+ and -naive MCM were infected with a low dose of Mtb for 6 weeks. MAIT cell frequency and function was examined within the peripheral blood, distal airways, as well as within Mtb-affected lymph nodes (LN) and tissues. Surprisingly, we found no evidence of MAIT cell responsiveness to Mtb within granulomas. Additionally, MAIT cells only minimally responded to mycobacterial stimulus in ex vivo functional assays. In contrast, most MAIT cell activation seemed to occur in samples with highly active SIV replication, including blood and SIV-infected LN. Finally, the ability of MAIT cells to secrete TNF (TNF) was impaired during SIV and Mtb co-infection, indicating that the two pathogens together could have a synergistically deleterious effect on MAIT cell function.

We carried RNA-seq on 40 ejaculates and we found that it contains a broad population of bacteria. The most abundant phyla were Proteobacteria (39.1%), Firmicutes (27.5%), Actinobacteria (14.9%) and Bacteroidetes (5.7%). The predominant species contaminated sperm after ejaculation from soil, faeces and water sources (Bacillus megaterium, Brachybacterium faecium, Bacillus coagulans). Some potential pathogens were also found but at relatively low levels (Escherichia coli, Clostridioides difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis). We also identified 3 potential antibiotic resistant genes from E. coli against chloramphenicol, Neisseria meningitidis against spectinomycin and Staphylococcus aureus against linezolid. None of these genes were highly abundant. Finally, we classified the ejaculates into categories according to their bacterial features and semen quality parameters and identified two categories that significantly differed for 5 semen quality traits and 13 bacterial features including the genera Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas and Rhodobacter. Our results show that boar semen contains a rich microbiome with potential pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes which may affect its reproductive performance.",2020-03-18,genomics,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,the microbiome plays a key role in homeostasis and health and it has been also linked to fertility and semen quality in several animal species including swine despite the more than likely importance of sperm bacteria on the boars reproductive ability and the dissemination of pathogens and antimicrobial resistance genes a high throughput characterization of the swine sperm microbiome remains undone the current study aimed at profiling the boar sperm bacterial population and its relationship with seven semen quality traits we carried rna seq on ejaculates and we found that it contains a broad population of bacteria the most abundant phyla were proteobacteria firmicutes actinobacteria and bacteroidetes the predominant species contaminated sperm after ejaculation from soil faeces and water sources bacillus megaterium brachybacterium faecium bacillus coagulans some potential pathogens were also found but at relatively low levels escherichia coli clostridioides difficile clostridium perfringens clostridium botulinum and mycobacterium tuberculosis we also identified potential antibiotic resistant genes from e coli against chloramphenicol neisseria meningitidis against spectinomycin and staphylococcus aureus against linezolid none of these genes were highly abundant finally we classified the ejaculates into categories according to their bacterial features and semen quality parameters and identified two categories that significantly differed for semen quality traits and bacterial features including the genera acinetobacter stenotrophomonas and rhodobacter our results show that boar semen contains a rich microbiome with potential pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes which may affect its reproductive performance,microbiome play key role homeostasis health also link fertility semen quality several animal specie include swine despite likely importance sperm bacteria boar reproductive ability dissemination pathogen antimicrobial resistance gene high throughput characterization swine sperm microbiome remain undone current study aim profiling boar sperm bacterial population relationship seven semen quality trait carry rna seq ejaculate find contain broad population bacteria abundant phyla proteobacteria firmicute actinobacteria bacteroidete predominant specie contaminate sperm ejaculation soil faece water source bacillus megaterium brachybacterium faecium bacillus coagulan potential pathogen also find relatively low level escherichia coli clostridioide difficile clostridium perfringens clostridium botulinum mycobacterium tuberculosis also identify potential antibiotic resistant gene coli chloramphenicol neisseria meningitidis spectinomycin staphylococcus aureus linezolid none gene highly abundant finally classify ejaculate category accord bacterial feature semen quality parameter identify two category significantly differ semen quality trait bacterial feature include genera acinetobacter stenotrophomonas rhodobacter result show boar semen contain rich microbiome potential pathogen antibiotic resistance gene may affect reproductive performance
10.1101/2020.04.22.055178,"In silico discovery and biological validation of ligands of FAD synthase, a promising new antimicrobial target","New treatments for diseases caused by antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms can be developed by identifying unexplored therapeutic targets and by designing efficient drug screening protocols. In this study, we have screened a library of compounds to find ligands for the flavin-adenine dinucleotide synthase (FADS) -a potential target for drug design against tuberculosis and pneumonia- by implementing a new and efficient virtual screening protocol. The protocol has been developed for the in silico search of ligands of unexplored therapeutic targets, for which limited information about ligands or ligand-receptor structures is available. It implements an integrative funnel-like strategy with filtering layers that increase in computational accuracy. The protocol starts with a pharmacophore-based virtual screening strategy that uses ligand-free receptor conformations from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Then, it performs a molecular docking stage using several docking programs and an exponential consensus ranking strategy. The last filter, samples the conformations of compounds bound to the target using MD simulations. The MD conformations are scored using several traditional scoring functions in combination with a newly-proposed score that takes into account the fluctuations of the molecule with a Morse-based potential. The protocol was optimized and validated using a compound library with known ligands of the Corynebacterium ammoniagenes FADS. Then, it was used to find new FADS ligands from a compound library of 14,000 molecules. A small set of 17 in silico filtered molecules were tested experimentally. We identified five inhibitors of the activity of the flavin adenylyl transferase mononucleotide of the FADS, and some of them were able to inhibit growth of three bacterial species: Corynebacterium ammoniagenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, where the former two are human pathogens. Overall, the results show that the integrative VS protocol is a cost-effective solution for the discovery of ligands of unexplored therapeutic targets.

Author summaryDeveloping cures for antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms is a pressing necessity. Addressing this problem requires the discovery of novel therapeutic targets -for example, bacterial proteins with no human homologues- and the development of cost-effective drug screening protocols. In this work, we tackled the problem on both sides. We developed an efficient and successful integrative computational protocol for screening inhibitory-molecules for unexplored targets.

10.1101/2020.04.29.068254,Predicting Antimicrobial Resistance Using Conserved Genes,"A growing number of studies have shown that machine learning algorithms can be used to accurately predict antimicrobial resistance (AMR) phenotypes from bacterial sequence data. In these studies, models are typically trained using input features derived from comprehensive sets of known AMR genes or whole genome sequences. However, it can be difficult to determine whether genomes and their corresponding sets of AMR genes are complete when sequencing contaminated or metagenomic samples. In this study, we explore the possibility of using incomplete genome sequence data to predict AMR phenotypes. Machine learning models were built from randomly-selected sets of core genes that are held in common among the members of a species, and the AMR-conferring genes were removed based on their protein annotations. For Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella enterica, and Staphylococcus aureus, we report that it is possible to classify susceptible and resistant phenotypes with average F1 scores ranging from 0.80-0.89 with as few as 100 conserved non-AMR genes, with very major error rates ranging from 0.11-0.23 and major error rates ranging from 0.10-0.20. Models built from core genes have predictive power in the cases where the primary AMR mechanism results from SNPs or horizontal gene transfer. By randomly sampling non-overlapping sets of core genes for use in these models, we show that F1 scores and error rates are stable and have little variance between replicates. Potential biases from strain-specific SNPs, phylogenetic sampling, and imbalances in the phylogenetic distribution of susceptible and resistant strains do not appear to have an impact on this result. Although these small core gene models have lower accuracies and higher error rates than models built from the corresponding assembled genomes, the results suggest that sufficient variation exists in the core non-AMR genes of a species for predicting AMR phenotypes. Overall this study suggests that building models from conserved genes may be a potentially useful strategy for predicting AMR phenotypes when genomes are incomplete.",2020-04-29,bioinformatics,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,a growing number of studies have shown that machine learning algorithms can be used to accurately predict antimicrobial resistance amr phenotypes from bacterial sequence data in these studies models are typically trained using input features derived from comprehensive sets of known amr genes or whole genome sequences however it can be difficult to determine whether genomes and their corresponding sets of amr genes are complete when sequencing contaminated or metagenomic samples in this study we explore the possibility of using incomplete genome sequence data to predict amr phenotypes machine learning models were built from randomly selected sets of core genes that are held in common among the members of a species and the amr conferring genes were removed based on their protein annotations for klebsiella pneumoniae mycobacterium tuberculosis salmonella enterica and staphylococcus aureus we report that it is possible to classify susceptible and resistant phenotypes with average f scores ranging from with as few as conserved non amr genes with very major error rates ranging from and major error rates ranging from models built from core genes have predictive power in the cases where the primary amr mechanism results from snps or horizontal gene transfer by randomly sampling non overlapping sets of core genes for use in these models we show that f scores and error rates are stable and have little variance between replicates potential biases from strain specific snps phylogenetic sampling and imbalances in the phylogenetic distribution of susceptible and resistant strains do not appear to have an impact on this result although these small core gene models have lower accuracies and higher error rates than models built from the corresponding assembled genomes the results suggest that sufficient variation exists in the core non amr genes of a species for predicting amr phenotypes overall this study suggests that building models from conserved genes may be a potentially useful strategy for predicting amr phenotypes when genomes are incomplete,grow number study show machine learning algorithm use accurately predict antimicrobial resistance amr phenotypes bacterial sequence datum study model typically train use input feature derive comprehensive set know amr gene whole genome sequence however difficult determine whether genome corresponding set amr gene complete sequencing contaminate metagenomic sample study explore possibility use incomplete genome sequence datum predict amr phenotype machine learning model build randomly select set core gene hold common among member specie amr confer gene remove base protein annotation klebsiella pneumoniae mycobacterium tuberculosis salmonella enterica staphylococcus aureus report possible classify susceptible resistant phenotype average score range conserve non amr gene major error rate range major error rate range model build core gene predictive power case primary amr mechanism result snps horizontal gene transfer randomly sample non overlap set core gene use model show score error rate stable little variance replicate potential bias strain specific snps phylogenetic sampling imbalance phylogenetic distribution susceptible resistant strain appear impact result although small core gene model low accuracy high error rate model build correspond assemble genome result suggest sufficient variation exist core non amr gene specie predict amr phenotype overall study suggest building model conserve gene may potentially useful strategy predict amr phenotype genome incomplete

Infection leads to either an asymptomatic latent state or TB disease. Memory T cells have been implicated in TB disease progression, but the specific cell states involved have not yet been delineated because of the limited scope of traditional profiling strategies. Furthermore, immune activation during infection confounds underlying differences in T cell state distributions that influence risk of progression. Here, we used a multimodal single-cell approach to integrate measurements of transcripts and 30 functionally relevant surface proteins to comprehensively define the memory T cell landscape at steady state (i.e., outside of active infection). We profiled 500,000 memory T cells from 259 Peruvians > 4.7 years after they had either latent M.tb infection or active disease and defined 31 distinct memory T cell states, including a CD4+CD26+CD161+CCR6+ effector memory state that was significantly reduced in patients who had developed active TB (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.73-0.87, p = 1.21 x 10-6).

H37Rv induced significantly increased IL-1{beta} production by BMDMs compared to non-infected BMDMs. In contrast, H37Rv:{Delta}3875 induced significantly less mature IL-1{beta} production despite eliciting comparable levels of pro-IL-1{beta} and IL-8 from BMDMs compared to H37Rv and H37Rv:{Delta}3875C.

Examination of the functional genomics of M.tb and development of drugs and vaccines are hampered by the complicated and time-consuming genetic manipulation techniques for M.tb. Here, we reprogrammed M.tb endogenous type III-A CRISPR-Cas10 system for simple and efficient gene editing, RNA interference and screening via simple delivery of a plasmid harboring a mini-CRISPR array, thereby avoiding the introduction of exogenous proteins and minimizing proteotoxicity. We demonstrated that M.tb genes were efficiently and specifically knocked-in/out by this system, which was confirmed by whole-genome sequencing. This system was further employed for single and simultaneous multiple-gene RNA interference. Moreover, we successfully applied this system for genome-wide CRISPR interference screening to identify the in-vitro and intracellular growth-regulating genes. This system can be extensively used to explore the functional genomics of M.tb and facilitate the development of new anti-Mycobacterial drugs and vaccines.

10.1101/2020.02.19.955203,Differential Host Gene Signatures in Response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection,"Tuberculosis (TB) represents a global public health threat and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Effective control of TB is complicated with the emergence of multidrug resistance. Yet, there is still a fundamental gap in understanding the complex and dynamic interactions between different Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and the host. In this project, we investigated the host immune response to different M. tuberculosis strains, including avirulent or virulent and rifampin-resistant or isoniazid-resistant strains in THP-1 cells. We identified major differences in the gene response profiles in response to infection with these strains. The expression of IDO1 and IL-1{beta} in the infected cells was stronger in all virulent M. tuberculosis strains. The most striking result was the overexpression of many interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in cells infected with the isoniazid-resistant strain, compared to the rifampin-drug resistant strain and the drug-sensitive strain. A transcription regulation analysis of the differentially expressed genes in infected THP-1 cells implicated two major transcription factors, NF-{kappa}B and STAT1. The differentially expressed ISGs in response to the isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis strain were associated with STAT1 signaling, while the expression of many cytokines, such IL-1{beta}, was associated with NF-{kappa}B signaling. Our data suggest that the isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis strain preferentially activates STAT1 in response to cGAS-STING activation and induces a host immune response signature that is characteristic of isoniazid resistance.

Solving this problem requires a transparent, accurate, and flexible predictive model. The methods currently used for this purpose rarely satisfy all of these criteria. On the one hand, approaches based on testing strains against a catalogue of previously identified mutations often yield poor predictive performance; on the other hand, machine learning techniques typically have higher predictive accuracy, but often lack interpretability and may learn patterns that produce accurate predictions for the wrong reasons. Current interpretable methods may either exhibit a lower accuracy or lack the flexibility needed to generalize them to previously unseen data.

ContributionIn this paper we propose a novel technique, inspired by the group testing and Boolean compressed sensing, which yields highly accurate predictions, interpretable results, and is flexible enough to be optimized for various evaluation metrics at the same time.

ResultsWe test the predictive accuracy of our approach on five first-line and seven second-line antibiotics used for treating tuberculosis. We find that it has a higher or comparable accuracy to that of commonly used machine learning models, and is able to identify variants in genes with previously reported association to drug resistance. Our method is intrinsically interpretable, and can be customized for different evaluation metrics.

10.1101/2020.03.02.974360,Evaluating aroA gene essentiality and EPSP synthase vulnerability in Mycobacterium smegmatis under different nutritional conditions,"The epidemiological importance of bacteria from the genus Mycobacterium is indisputable and the necessity to find new molecules that can inhibit their growth is urgent. The shikimate pathway, required for the synthesis of important metabolites in bacteria, represents a target for inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth. The aroA-encoded 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) enzyme catalyzes the sixth step of the shikimate pathway. In this study, we combined gene knockout, gene knockdown and kinetic assays to evaluate aroA gene essentiality and the vulnerability of its protein product, EPSPS synthase from Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsEPSPS), under different nutritional conditions. We demonstrate by an allelic exchange-based gene knockout approach the essentiality of MsEPSPS under rich and poor nutritional conditions. By performing gene complementation experiments with wild-type (WT) and point mutant versions of aroA gene, together with kinetic assays using WT and mutant recombinant proteins, we show that aroA gene essentiality depends on MsEPSPS activity. To evaluate MsEPSPS vulnerability, we performed gene knockdown experiments using the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats interference (CRISPRi) system. The experiments were performed in both rich and defined (poor) media, using three different repression forces for aroA gene. We only observed growth impairment when bacteria were grown in defined medium without supplementation of aromatic amino acids, thereby indicating that MsEPSPS vulnerability depends on the environment conditions.

ImportanceWe evaluated both gene essentiality and target vulnerability of the enzyme that catalyzes the sixth step of the shikimate pathway, the aroA-encoded 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase from Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsEPSPS). Combining gene knockout experiments and kinetic assays, we established a causal link between aroA gene essentiality and the biological function of EPSPS protein, which we advocate is an indispensable step for target validation. Moreover, we characterized MsEPSPS vulnerability under different nutritional conditions and found it is a vulnerable target only when M. smegmatis is grown under poor nutritional conditions without supplementation with aromatic amino acids.

10.1101/834150,Improving tuberculosis surveillance by detecting international transmission using publicly available whole-genome sequencing data,"IntroductionImproving the surveillance of tuberculosis (TB) is especially important for multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB. The large amount of publicly available whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data for TB gives us the chance to re-use data and to perform additional analysis at a large scale.

AimWe assessed the usefulness of raw WGS data of global MDR/XDR-TB isolates available from public repositories to improve TB surveillance.

MethodsWe extracted raw WGS data and the related metadata of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates available from the Sequence Read Archive. We compared this public dataset with WGS data and metadata of 131 MDR- and XDR-TB isolates from Germany in 2012-2013.

ResultsWe aggregated a dataset that includes 1,081 MDR and 250 XDR isolates among which we identified 133 molecular clusters. In 16 clusters, the isolates were from at least two different countries. For example, cluster2 included 56 MDR/XDR isolates from Moldova, Georgia, and Germany. By comparing the WGS data from Germany and the public dataset, we found that 11 clusters contained at least one isolate from Germany and at least one isolate from another country. We could, therefore, connect TB cases despite missing epidemiological information.

ConclusionWe demonstrated the added value of using WGS raw data from public repositories to contribute to TB surveillance. By comparing the German and the public dataset, we identified potential international transmission events. Thus, using this approach might support the interpretation of national surveillance results in an international context.",2020-03-23,microbiology,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,introductionimproving the surveillance of tuberculosis tb is especially important for multidrug resistant mdr and extensively drug resistant xdr tb the large amount of publicly available whole genome sequencing wgs data for tb gives us the chance to re use data and to perform additional analysis at a large scale aimwe assessed the usefulness of raw wgs data of global mdr xdr tb isolates available from public repositories to improve tb surveillance methodswe extracted raw wgs data and the related metadata of mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates available from the sequence read archive we compared this public dataset with wgs data and metadata of mdr and xdr tb isolates from germany in resultswe aggregated a dataset that includes mdr and xdr isolates among which we identified molecular clusters in clusters the isolates were from at least two different countries for example cluster included mdr xdr isolates from moldova georgia and germany by comparing the wgs data from germany and the public dataset we found that clusters contained at least one isolate from germany and at least one isolate from another country we could therefore connect tb cases despite missing epidemiological information conclusionwe demonstrated the added value of using wgs raw data from public repositories to contribute to tb surveillance by comparing the german and the public dataset we identified potential international transmission events thus using this approach might support the interpretation of national surveillance results in an international context,introductionimprove surveillance tuberculosis especially important multidrug resistant mdr extensively drug resistant xdr large amount publicly available whole genome sequence wgs datum give chance use datum perform additional analysis large scale aimwe assess usefulness raw wgs datum global mdr xdr isolate available public repository improve surveillance methodswe extract raw wgs datum relate metadata mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate available sequence read archive compare public dataset wgs datum metadata mdr xdr isolate germany resultswe aggregate dataset include mdr xdr isolate among identify molecular cluster cluster isolate least two different country example cluster include mdr xdr isolate moldova georgia germany compare wgs datum germany public dataset find cluster contain least one isolate germany least one isolate another country could therefore connect case despite miss epidemiological information conclusionwe demonstrate add value use wgs raw data public repository contribute surveillance compare german public dataset identify potential international transmission event thus use approach might support interpretation national surveillance result international context
10.1101/2020.01.15.907279,Deletion of RsmE 16S rRNA methyltransferase leads to low level increase in aminoglycoside resistance in Mycobacterium smegmatis,"Owing to its central role in cellular function, ribosome is one of the most common targets of antibiotics in bacteria. Mutations in rrs gene, ribosomal protein genes, methyltransfersases or drug influx/efflux are often found to overcome the drug response. Despite modulation of methylation pattern in the ribosome through mutations in the methyltransferases as one of key modulators of drug response, rsmG (gidB) is the only conserved methyltransferase associated with low-level drug resistance in large number of mycobacterial isolates. Here, we present the first evidence of association of methylation by mycobacterial RsmE, that methylates U1498 of 16S rRNA, with low levels of drug resistance. Deletion of the RsmE-homolog of Mycobacterium smegmatis leads to at least two-fold increase in the inhibitory concentration of aminoglycosides that bind in the decoding center proximal to U1498 in the 30S subunit. The change in inhibitory concentrations was highly specific and does not show any cross-resistance to drugs of other classes. Surprisingly, Rv2372c, the RsmE-homolog of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has the largest number of mutations among conserved ribosomal methyltransfersases, after gidB, highlighting the role of mutations in the RsmE methyltransferase as a key emerging mechanism of drug resistance in clinical strains of M. tuberculosis.

10.1101/828574,Ebselen attenuates mycobacterial virulence through inhibition of ESX-1 secretion,"The type VII secretion system ESX-1 mediates virulence in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium marinum. We find that in M. marinum, the synthetic organoselenium compound ebselen inhibits secretion of ESAT-6, a major ESX-1 substrate. We find that ebselen inhibits the in vitro activity of the ESX-1 AAA+ ATPase EccA1, which potentiates ESX-1 substrate secretion and function. Ebselen modifies a cysteine in its N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domain that is required for EccA1s in vitro ATPase activity. Surprisingly, mutational analyses show this this cysteine is not required for ESX-1 secretion or ebselens activity, showing that ebselen inhibits ESX-1 secretion independently of inhibiting EccA1 activity in vitro. While the mechanism by which ebselen inhibits ESX-1 secretion remains elusive, we show that it attenuates ESX-1-mediated damage of M. marinum-containing macrophage phagosomes and inhibits intramacrophage growth. Extending our studies to M. tuberculosis, we find that ebselen inhibits ESX-1 secretion and phagosomal membrane damage in this organism. This work provides insight into EccA1 biology.

10.1101/2020.05.06.077883,Coronavirus activates a stem cell-mediated defense mechanism that accelerates the activation of dormant tuberculosis: implications for the COVID-19 pandemic,"We postulate that similar to bacteria, adult stem cells may also exhibit an innate defense mechanism to protect their niche. Here, we provide preliminary data on stem cell based innate defense against a mouse model of coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus-1 (MHV-1) infection. In a mouse model of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) mediated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) dormancy, MHV-1 infection in the lung exhibited 20 fold lower viral loads than the healthy control mice, suggesting the potential enhancement of an anti-MHV-1 defense by Mtb. This defense mechanism involves the in vivo expansion and reprogramming of CD271+MSCs in the lung to an enhanced stemness phenotype. The reprogrammed MSCs facilitate the activation of stemness genes, intracellular Mtb replication, and extracellular release of Mtb. The conditioned media of the reprogrammed MSCs exhibit direct anti-viral activity in an in vitro model of MHV-1 induced toxicity to type II alveolar epithelial cells. Thus, our data suggest that reprogrammed MSCs exert a unique innate defense against MHV-1 by activating dormant Mtb.

10.1101/2020.05.25.114470,"Tuberculosis causes highly conserved metabolic changes in human patients, mycobacteria-infected mice and zebrafish larvae","Tuberculosis is a highly infectious and potentially fatal disease accompanied by wasting symptoms, which cause severe metabolic changes in infected people. In this study we have compared the effect of mycobacteria infection on the level of metabolites in blood of humans and mice and whole zebrafish larvae using one highly standardized mass spectrometry pipeline, ensuring technical comparability of the results. Quantification of a range of circulating small amines showed that the levels of the majority of these compounds were significantly decreased in all three groups of infected organisms. Ten of these metabolites were common between the three different organisms comprising: methionine, asparagine, cysteine, threonine, serine, tryptophan, leucine, citrulline, ethanolamine and phenylalanine. The metabolomic changes of zebrafish larvae after infection were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our study identified common biomarkers for tuberculosis disease in humans, mice and zebrafish, showing across species conservation of metabolic reprogramming processes as a result of disease.

Improved rapid diagnosis and antimicrobial resistance determination, such as by whole genome sequencing, are required. Our aim was to develop a simple, low-cost method of preparing DNA for Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing direct from MTB positive clinical samples (without culture). Simultaneous sputum liquefaction, bacteria heat-inactivation (99{degrees}C/30min) and enrichment for Mycobacteria DNA was achieved using an equal volume of thermo-protection buffer (4M KCl, 0.05M HEPES buffer pH7.5, 0.1% DTT). The buffer emulated intracellular conditions found in hyperthermophiles, thus protecting DNA from rapid thermo-degradation, which renders it a poor template for sequencing. Initial validation employed Mycobacteria DNA (extracted or intracellular). Next, mock clinical samples (infection-negative human sputum spiked 0-105 BCG cells/ml) underwent liquefaction in thermo-protection buffer and heat-inactivation. DNA was extracted and sequenced. Human DNA degraded faster than Mycobacteria DNA, resulting in target enrichment. Four replicate experiments each demonstrated detection at 101 BCG cells/ml, with 31-59 MTB complex reads. Maximal genome coverage (>97% at 5x-depth) was achieved at 104 BCG cells/ml; >91% coverage (1x depth) at 103 BCG cells/ml.

10.1101/2020.03.19.990861,Dodecin as carrier protein for immunizations and bioengineering applications,"In bioengineering, scaffold proteins have been increasingly used to recruit molecules to parts of a cell, or to enhance the efficacy of biosynthetic or signaling pathways. For example, scaffolds can be used to make weak or non-immunogenic small molecules immunogenic by attaching them to the scaffold, in this role called carrier. Here, we present the dodecin from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtDod) as a new scaffold protein. MtDod is a homododecameric complex of spherical shape, high stability and robust assembly, which allows the attachment of cargo at its surface. We show that mtDod, either directly loaded with cargo or equipped with domains for non-covalent and covalent loading of cargo, can be produced recombinantly in high quantity and quality in Escherichia coli. Fusions of mtDod with proteins of up to four times the size of mtDod, e.g. with monomeric superfolder green fluorescent protein creating a 437 kDa large dodecamer, were successfully purified, showing mtDods ability to function as recruitment hub. Further, mtDod equipped with SYNZIP and SpyCatcher domains for post-translational recruitment of cargo was prepared of which the mtDod/SpyCatcher system proved to be particularly useful. In a case study, we finally show that mtDod peptide fusions allow producing antibodies against human heat shock proteins and the C-terminus of heat shock cognate 70 interacting protein (CHIP).

10.1101/2020.02.25.964312,Mucosal vaccination with CysVac2/Advax induces Th17 lung-resident CD4+ T cells and interleukin-17-dependant protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection,"The development of effective vaccines against bacterial lung infections requires the induction of protective, pathogen-specific immune responses without deleterious inflammation within the pulmonary environment. Here, we made use of a polysaccharide-adjuvanted vaccine approach to elicit resident pulmonary T cells to protect against aerosol Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Intratracheal administration of the multistage fusion protein CysVac2 and the delta-inulin adjuvant Advax (formulated with a TLR9 agonist) provided superior protection against aerosol M. tuberculosis infection in mice, compared to parenteral delivery. Surprisingly, removal of the TLR9 agonist did not impact vaccine protection despite a reduction in cytokine-secreting T cell subsets, particularly CD4+ IFN-{gamma}+IL-2+TNF+ multifunctional T cells. CysVac2/Advax-mediated protection was associated with the induction of lung-resident, antigen-specific memory CD4+ T cells that expressed IL-17 and ROR{gamma}t, the master transcriptional regulator of Th17 differentiation. IL-17 was identified as a key mediator of vaccine efficacy, with blocking of IL-17 during M. tuberculosis challenge reducing phagocyte influx, suppressing priming of pathogen-specific CD4+ T cells in local lymph nodes and ablating vaccine-induced protection. These findings suggest that tuberculosis vaccines such as CysVac2/Advax that are capable of eliciting Th17 lung-resident memory T cells are promising candidates for progression to human trials.

ImportanceMycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), kills more individuals each year than any other single pathogen. The only approved vaccine, BCG, administered intradermally, is unreliable in protecting against pulmonary TB, therefore a more effective vaccine is critical for global control of the disease. Vaccination in the lung would be a rational way of inducing a local memory immune response to TB, however vaccine platforms would need to deliver antigens to delicate mucosal surfaces without inducing deleterious inflammatory responses.

We sought potential targets for host-directed therapies (HDTs) by investigating the host immune response to mycobacterial infection. We used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated high-throughput genetic screens to identify perturbations that improve the survival of human phagocytic cells infected with Mycobacterium bovis BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin), as a proxy for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Many of these perturbations constrained the growth of intracellular mycobacteria. We identified over 100 genes associated with diverse biological pathways as potential HDT targets. We validated key components of the type I interferon and aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathways that respond to the small-molecule inhibitors cerdulatinib and CH223191, respectively; these inhibitors enhanced human macrophage survival and limited the intracellular growth of Mtb. Thus, high-throughput functional genomic screens can elucidate highly complex host-pathogen interactions and serve to identify HDTs with the potential to improve TB treatment.",2020-03-31,microbiology,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,existing antibiotics are inadequate to defeat tuberculosis tb a leading cause of death worldwide we sought potential targets for host directed therapies hdts by investigating the host immune response to mycobacterial infection we used crispr cas mediated high throughput genetic screens to identify perturbations that improve the survival of human phagocytic cells infected with mycobacterium bovis bcg bacillus calmette guerin as a proxy for mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb many of these perturbations constrained the growth of intracellular mycobacteria we identified over genes associated with diverse biological pathways as potential hdt targets we validated key components of the type i interferon and aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathways that respond to the small molecule inhibitors cerdulatinib and ch respectively these inhibitors enhanced human macrophage survival and limited the intracellular growth of mtb thus high throughput functional genomic screens can elucidate highly complex host pathogen interactions and serve to identify hdts with the potential to improve tb treatment,exist antibiotic inadequate defeat tuberculosis lead cause death worldwide seek potential target host direct therapy hdts investigate host immune response mycobacterial infection use crispr cas mediate high throughput genetic screen identify perturbation improve survival human phagocytic cell infect mycobacterium bovis bcg bacillus calmette guerin proxy mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb many perturbation constrain growth intracellular mycobacteria identify gene associate diverse biological pathway potential hdt target validate key component type interferon aryl hydrocarbon receptor signal pathway respond small molecule inhibitor cerdulatinib respectively inhibitor enhance human macrophage survival limited intracellular growth mtb thus high throughput functional genomic screen elucidate highly complex host pathogen interaction serve identify hdts potential improve treatment
10.1101/2020.05.04.076596,Mycobacterium marinum phthiocerol dimycocerosates enhance macrophage phagosomal permeabilization and membrane damage,"Phthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIMs) are a class of mycobacterial lipids that promote virulence in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium marinum. It has recently been shown that PDIMs work in concert with the M. tuberculosis Type VII secretion system ESX-1 to permeabilize the phagosomal membranes of infected macrophages. As the zebrafish-M. marinum model of infection has revealed the critical role of PDIM at the host-pathogen interface, we set to determine if PDIMs contributed to phagosomal permeabilization in M. marinum. Using an{Delta} mmpL7 mutant defective in PDIM transport, we find the PDIM-ESX-1 interaction to be conserved in an M. marinum macrophage infection model. However, we find PDIM and ESX-1 mutants differ in their degree of defect, with the PDIM mutant retaining more membrane damaging activity. Using an in vitro hemolysis assay-- a common surrogate for cytolytic activity, we find that PDIM and ESX-1 differ in their contributions: the ESX-1 mutant loses hemolytic activity while PDIM retains it. Our observations confirm the involvement of PDIMs in phagosomal permeabilization in M. marinum infection and suggest that PDIM enhances the membrane disrupting activity of pathogenic mycobacteria and indicates that the role they play in damaging phagosomal and red blood cell membranes may differ.",2020-05-04,microbiology,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,phthiocerol dimycocerosates pdims are a class of mycobacterial lipids that promote virulence in mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium marinum it has recently been shown that pdims work in concert with the m tuberculosis type vii secretion system esx to permeabilize the phagosomal membranes of infected macrophages as the zebrafish m marinum model of infection has revealed the critical role of pdim at the host pathogen interface we set to determine if pdims contributed to phagosomal permeabilization in m marinum using an delta mmpl mutant defective in pdim transport we find the pdim esx interaction to be conserved in an m marinum macrophage infection model however we find pdim and esx mutants differ in their degree of defect with the pdim mutant retaining more membrane damaging activity using an in vitro hemolysis assay a common surrogate for cytolytic activity we find that pdim and esx differ in their contributions the esx mutant loses hemolytic activity while pdim retains it our observations confirm the involvement of pdims in phagosomal permeabilization in m marinum infection and suggest that pdim enhances the membrane disrupting activity of pathogenic mycobacteria and indicates that the role they play in damaging phagosomal and red blood cell membranes may differ,phthiocerol dimycocerosate pdim class mycobacterial lipid promote virulence mycobacterium tuberculosis mycobacterium marinum recently show pdim work concert tuberculosis type vii secretion system esx permeabilize phagosomal membrane infect macrophage zebrafish marinum model infection reveal critical role pdim host pathogen interface set determine pdim contribute phagosomal permeabilization marinum use delta mmpl mutant defective pdim transport find pdim esx interaction conserve marinum macrophage infection model however find pdim esx mutant differ degree defect pdim mutant retain membrane damaging activity use vitro hemolysis assay common surrogate cytolytic activity find pdim esx differ contribution esx mutant lose hemolytic activity pdim retain observation confirm involvement pdim phagosomal permeabilization marinum infection suggest pdim enhance membrane disrupt activity pathogenic mycobacteria indicate role play damage phagosomal red blood cell membrane may differ
10.1101/2020.02.10.941963,Putative TetR family transcriptional regulator Rv1019 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an auto-repressor and a negative regulator of mfd-mazG operon,"Regulation of gene expression at the level of transcription is one of the ways living organisms differentially make proteins in their cells. Intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis persists in the host for years in a latent state in structures called granuloma. Rv1019, a member of an uncharacterized TetR family of transcriptional regulators of Mtb H37Rv, was found to be differentially expressed during dormancy and reactivation in vitro. By GFP reporter assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immuno-precipitation assays we showed that this protein binds to its own promoter and acts as a negative regulator of its own expression. It forms dimers in vitro which is essential for the DNA binding activity, which is abrogated in the presence of tetracycline. We show that Rv1019 and downstream genes Rv1020 (mfd), Rv1021 (mazG) are co-transcribed. Constitutive expression of Rv1019 in M. smegmatis downregulated MSMEG_5423 (mfd) and MSMEG_5422 (mazG) suggesting that Rv1019 negatively regulates these downstream genes. M. smegmatis expressing Rv1019 was found to be sensitive to UV and H2O2 compared to the control suggesting its role in regulating DNA damage response in mycobacterium.

ImportanceOne of the reasons for our inability to eradicate tuberculosis, in spite of the availability of effective drugs and BCG vaccine, is the ingenuity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to survive, persist and multiply inside the lungs where it employs clever strategies to counter the host defence systems. The number of anti-TB drugs in the current therapeutic regimen is limited, and the long duration of treatment increases the chances for emergence of drug resistant bacteria. Rv1019, a transcriptional regulator differentially expressed in in vitro dormancy-reactivation studies, was found to be an auto-repressor and negatively regulating mfd-mazG operon involved in DNA repair.

Using a non-human primate (NHP) aerosol model, we studied the kinetics, phenotypes and functions of Mtb antigen-specific T cells in peripheral and lung compartments of Mtb-infected asymptomatic rhesus macaques by longitudinally sampling blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), for up to 24 weeks post-infection. We found significantly higher frequencies of Mtb-specific effector and memory CD4 and CD8 T cells producing IFN-{gamma} in the airways compared to peripheral blood, which were maintained throughout the study period. Moreover, Mtb-specific IL-17+ and IL-17/IFN-{gamma} double-positive T cells were present in the airways but were largely absent in the periphery, suggesting that balanced mucosal Th1/Th17 responses are associated with LTBI. The majority of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells that homed to the airways expressed the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and co-expressed CCR6.

10.1101/2020.04.14.040048,A modular microscale granuloma model for immune-microenvironment signaling studies in vitro,"Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most potent infectious diseases in the world, causing more deaths than any other single infectious agent. TB infection is caused by inhalation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and subsequent phagocytosis and migration into the lung tissue by innate immune cells (e.g., alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells), resulting in the formation of a fused mass of immune cells known as the granuloma. Considered the pathological hallmark of TB, the granuloma is a complex microenvironment that is crucial for pathogen containment as well as pathogen survival. Disruption of the delicate granuloma microenvironment via numerous stimuli, such as variations in cytokine secretions, nutrient availability, and the makeup of immune cell population, can lead to an active infection. Herein, we present a novel in vitro model to examine the soluble factor signaling between a mycobacterial infection and its surrounding environment. Adapting a newly developed suspended microfluidic platform, known as Stacks, we established a modular microscale infection model containing human immune cells and a model mycobacterial strain that can easily integrate with different microenvironmental cues through simple spatial and temporal ""stacking"" of each module of the platform. We validate the establishment of suspended microscale (4 L) infection cultures that secrete increased levels of proinflammatory factors IL-6, VEGF, and TNF upon infection and form 3D aggregates (granuloma model) encapsulating the mycobacteria. As a proof of concept to demonstrate the capability of our platform to examine soluble factor signaling, we cocultured an in vitro angiogenesis model with the granuloma model and quantified morphology changes in endothelial structures as a result of culture conditions (P < 0.05 when comparing infected vs. uninfected coculture systems). We envision our modular in vitro granuloma model can be further expanded and adapted for studies focusing on the complex interplay between granulomatous structures and their surrounding microenvironment, as well as a complementary tool to augment in vivo signaling and mechanistic studies.",2020-04-15,bioengineering,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,tuberculosis tb is one of the most potent infectious diseases in the world causing more deaths than any other single infectious agent tb infection is caused by inhalation of mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb and subsequent phagocytosis and migration into the lung tissue by innate immune cells e g alveolar macrophages neutrophils dendritic cells resulting in the formation of a fused mass of immune cells known as the granuloma considered the pathological hallmark of tb the granuloma is a complex microenvironment that is crucial for pathogen containment as well as pathogen survival disruption of the delicate granuloma microenvironment via numerous stimuli such as variations in cytokine secretions nutrient availability and the makeup of immune cell population can lead to an active infection herein we present a novel in vitro model to examine the soluble factor signaling between a mycobacterial infection and its surrounding environment adapting a newly developed suspended microfluidic platform known as stacks we established a modular microscale infection model containing human immune cells and a model mycobacterial strain that can easily integrate with different microenvironmental cues through simple spatial and temporal stacking of each module of the platform we validate the establishment of suspended microscale l infection cultures that secrete increased levels of proinflammatory factors il vegf and tnf upon infection and form d aggregates granuloma model encapsulating the mycobacteria as a proof of concept to demonstrate the capability of our platform to examine soluble factor signaling we cocultured an in vitro angiogenesis model with the granuloma model and quantified morphology changes in endothelial structures as a result of culture conditions p when comparing infected vs uninfected coculture systems we envision our modular in vitro granuloma model can be further expanded and adapted for studies focusing on the complex interplay between granulomatous structures and their surrounding microenvironment as well as a complementary tool to augment in vivo signaling and mechanistic studies,tuberculosis one potent infectious disease world cause death single infectious agent infection cause inhalation mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb subsequent phagocytosis migration lung tissue innate immune cell alveolar macrophage neutrophil dendritic cell result formation fuse mass immune cell know granuloma consider pathological hallmark granuloma complex microenvironment crucial pathogen containment well pathogen survival disruption delicate granuloma microenvironment via numerous stimulus variation cytokine secretion nutrient availability makeup immune cell population lead active infection herein present novel vitro model examine soluble factor signal mycobacterial infection surround environment adapt newly develop suspend microfluidic platform know stack establish modular microscale infection model contain human immune cell model mycobacterial strain easily integrate different microenvironmental cue simple spatial temporal stacking module platform validate establishment suspend microscale infection culture secrete increase level proinflammatory factor vegf tnf upon infection form aggregate granuloma model encapsulate mycobacteria proof concept demonstrate capability platform examine soluble factor signal coculture vitro angiogenesis model granuloma model quantify morphology change endothelial structure result culture condition compare infected uninfected coculture system envision modular vitro granuloma model expand adapt study focus complex interplay granulomatous structure surround microenvironment well complementary tool augment vivo signal mechanistic study
10.1101/761551,IRG1 controls host responses to restrict Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the pathogen causing human tuberculosis, has evolved multiple strategies to successfully prevent clearance by immune cells and to establish dissemination and long-term survival in the host. The modulation of host immunity to maximize pathogen elimination while minimizing inflammation-mediated tissue damage may provide another tool to fight drug-resistant Mtb strains. Metabolic reprogramming of phagocytes can dramatically influence the intracellular colonization by Mtb and the key players involved in this process remain a matter of debate. Here, we demonstrate that aconitate decarboxylase 1 (Acod1; also known as immune-responsive gene 1, IRG1), which converts cis-aconitate into the metabolite itaconate, is a major player in controlling the acute phase of Mtb infection. Exposure of IRG1-deficient mice to a virulent Mtb strain (H37Rv) was lethal, while M. bovis BCG and the H37Ra attenuated Mtb strain induced neither lethality nor severe lung immunopathology. Lungs of IRG1-deficient mice infected by Mtb H37Rv displayed large areas of necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and neutrophil infiltration, accompanied by reduced levels of B and T lymphocytes and increased levels of alveolar and interstitial macrophage populations, compared to their wild type counterparts. Next, we show that IRG1, beyond its recruitment to Mtb-containing vacuoles, restricts Mtb replication and lipid droplets accumulation in phagocytes, hallmarks of a tight interplay between the bacillus and the host. Altogether, IRG1 confines the host response to create a favourable phagocytic environment for Mtb controlled intracellular replication.",2022-05-04,immunology,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb the pathogen causing human tuberculosis has evolved multiple strategies to successfully prevent clearance by immune cells and to establish dissemination and long term survival in the host the modulation of host immunity to maximize pathogen elimination while minimizing inflammation mediated tissue damage may provide another tool to fight drug resistant mtb strains metabolic reprogramming of phagocytes can dramatically influence the intracellular colonization by mtb and the key players involved in this process remain a matter of debate here we demonstrate that aconitate decarboxylase acod also known as immune responsive gene irg which converts cis aconitate into the metabolite itaconate is a major player in controlling the acute phase of mtb infection exposure of irg deficient mice to a virulent mtb strain h rv was lethal while m bovis bcg and the h ra attenuated mtb strain induced neither lethality nor severe lung immunopathology lungs of irg deficient mice infected by mtb h rv displayed large areas of necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and neutrophil infiltration accompanied by reduced levels of b and t lymphocytes and increased levels of alveolar and interstitial macrophage populations compared to their wild type counterparts next we show that irg beyond its recruitment to mtb containing vacuoles restricts mtb replication and lipid droplets accumulation in phagocytes hallmarks of a tight interplay between the bacillus and the host altogether irg confines the host response to create a favourable phagocytic environment for mtb controlled intracellular replication,mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb pathogen cause human tuberculosis evolve multiple strategy successfully prevent clearance immune cell establish dissemination long term survival host modulation host immunity maximize pathogen elimination minimize inflammation mediate tissue damage may provide another tool fight drug resistant mtb strain metabolic reprogramme phagocyte dramatically influence intracellular colonization mtb key player involve process remain matter debate demonstrate aconitate decarboxylase acod also know immune responsive gene irg convert cis aconitate metabolite itaconate major player control acute phase mtb infection exposure irg deficient mice virulent mtb strain lethal bovis bcg attenuate mtb strain induce neither lethality severe lung immunopathology lung irg deficient mouse infect mtb display large area necrotize granulomatous inflammation neutrophil infiltration accompany reduce level lymphocyte increase level alveolar interstitial macrophage population compare wild type counterpart next show irg beyond recruitment mtb contain vacuole restrict mtb replication lipid droplet accumulation phagocyte hallmark tight interplay bacillus host altogether irg confine host response create favourable phagocytic environment mtb control intracellular replication
10.1101/633768,An essential periplasmic protein coordinates lipid trafficking and is required for asymmetric polar growth in mycobacteria,"Mycobacteria, including the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, grow by inserting new cell wall material at their poles. This process and that of division are asymmetric, producing a phenotypically heterogeneous population of cells that respond non-uniformly to stress (Aldridge et al., 2012; Rego et al., 2017; Richardson et al., 2016). Surprisingly, deletion of a single gene - lamA - leads to more symmetry, and to a population of cells that is more uniformly killed by antibiotics (Rego et al., 2017). How does LamA create asymmetry? Here, using a combination of quantitative time-lapse imaging, bacterial genetics, and lipid profiling, we find that LamA recruits essential proteins involved in cell wall synthesis to one side of the cell - the old pole. One of these proteins, MSMEG_0317, here renamed PgfA, was of unknown function. We show that PgfA is a periplasmic protein that interacts with MmpL3, an essential transporter that flips mycolic acids in the form of trehalose monomycolate (TMM), across the plasma membrane. PgfA interacts with a TMM analog suggesting a direct role in TMM transport. Yet our data point to a broader function as well, as cells with altered PgfA levels have differences in the abundance of other lipids and are differentially reliant on those lipids for survival. Overexpression of PgfA, but not MmpL3, restores growth at the old poles in cells missing lamA. Together, our results suggest that PgfA is a key regulator of polar growth and cell envelope composition in mycobacteria, and that the LamA-mediated recruitment of this protein to one side of the cell is a required step in the establishment of cellular asymmetry.",2022-05-26,microbiology,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,mycobacteria including the human pathogen mycobacterium tuberculosis grow by inserting new cell wall material at their poles this process and that of division are asymmetric producing a phenotypically heterogeneous population of cells that respond non uniformly to stress aldridge et al rego et al richardson et al surprisingly deletion of a single gene lama leads to more symmetry and to a population of cells that is more uniformly killed by antibiotics rego et al how does lama create asymmetry here using a combination of quantitative time lapse imaging bacterial genetics and lipid profiling we find that lama recruits essential proteins involved in cell wall synthesis to one side of the cell the old pole one of these proteins msmeg here renamed pgfa was of unknown function we show that pgfa is a periplasmic protein that interacts with mmpl an essential transporter that flips mycolic acids in the form of trehalose monomycolate tmm across the plasma membrane pgfa interacts with a tmm analog suggesting a direct role in tmm transport yet our data point to a broader function as well as cells with altered pgfa levels have differences in the abundance of other lipids and are differentially reliant on those lipids for survival overexpression of pgfa but not mmpl restores growth at the old poles in cells missing lama together our results suggest that pgfa is a key regulator of polar growth and cell envelope composition in mycobacteria and that the lama mediated recruitment of this protein to one side of the cell is a required step in the establishment of cellular asymmetry,mycobacteria include human pathogen mycobacterium tuberculosis grow insert new cell wall material poles process division asymmetric produce phenotypically heterogeneous population cell respond non uniformly stress aldridge rego richardson surprisingly deletion single gene lama lead symmetry population cell uniformly kill antibiotic rego lama create asymmetry use combination quantitative time lapse image bacterial genetic lipid profiling find lama recruit essential protein involve cell wall synthesis one side cell old pole one protein msmeg rename pgfa unknown function show pgfa periplasmic protein interact mmpl essential transporter flip mycolic acid form trehalose monomycolate tmm across plasma membrane pgfa interact tmm analog suggest direct role tmm transport yet datum point broad function well cell alter pgfa level difference abundance lipid differentially reliant lipids survival overexpression pgfa mmpl restore growth old pole cell miss lama together result suggest pgfa key regulator polar growth cell envelope composition mycobacteria lama mediate recruitment protein one side cell require step establishment cellular asymmetry
10.1101/815241,An Evaluation of the In Vitro Roles and Mechanisms of Silibinin in Reducing Pyrazinamide- and Isoniazid-Induced Hepatocellular Damage,"Tuberculosis remains a significant infectious lung disease that affects millions of patients worldwide. Despite numerous existing drug regimens for tuberculosis, Drug-Induced Liver Injury is a major challenge that limits the effectiveness of these therapeutics. Two drugs that form the backbone of the commonly administered quadruple antitubercular regimen, i.e. pyrazinamide (PZA) and isoniazid (INH), are associated with such hepatotoxicity. The problem is compounded by the lack of safe and effective alternatives to the antitubercular regimen. Consequently, current research largely focuses on exploiting the hepatoprotective effect of nutraceutical compounds as complementary therapy. Silibinin, a herbal product widely believed to protect against various liver diseases, potentially provides a useful solution given its hepatoprotective mechanisms. In our study, we identified silibinins role in mitigating PZA- and INH-induced hepatotoxicity and elucidated a deeper mechanistic understanding of silibinins hepatoprotective ability. 25 M silibinin preserved the viability of human foetal hepatocyte line LO2 when co-administered with 80 mM INH and decreased apoptosis induced by a combination of 40 mM INH and 10 mM PZA by reducing oxidative damage to mitochondria, proteins, and lipids. Taken together, this proof-of-concept forms the rational basis for the further investigation of silibinins hepatoprotective effect in subsequent preclinical studies and clinical trials.

10.1101/845081,Spreading of a mycobacterial cell surface lipid into host epithelial membranes promotes infectivity,"Several virulence lipids populate the outer cell wall of pathogenic mycobacteria (Jackson, 2014). Phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), one of the most abundant outer membrane lipids (Anderson, 1929), plays important roles in both defending against host antimicrobial programs (Camacho et al., 2001; Cox et al., 1999; Murry et al., 2009) and in evading these programs altogether (Cambier et al., 2014a; Rousseau et al., 2004). Immediately following infection, mycobacteria rely on PDIM to evade toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent recruitment of bactericidal monocytes which can clear infection (Cambier et al., 2014b). To circumvent the limitations in using genetics to understand virulence lipid function, we developed a chemical approach to introduce a clickable, semi-synthetic PDIM onto the cell wall of Mycobacterium marinum. Upon infection of zebrafish, we found that PDIM rapidly spreads into host epithelial membranes, and that this spreading inhibits TLR activation. PDIMs ability to spread into epithelial membranes correlated with its enhanced fluidity afforded by its methyl-branched mycocerosic acids. Additionally, PDIMs affinity for cholesterol promoted its occupation of epithelial membranes; treatment of zebrafish with statins, cholesterol synthesis inhibitors, decreased spreading and provided protection from infection. This work establishes that interactions between host and pathogen lipids influence mycobacterial infectivity and suggests the use of statins as tuberculosis preventive therapy by inhibiting PDIM spread.",2020-06-30,microbiology,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,several virulence lipids populate the outer cell wall of pathogenic mycobacteria jackson phthiocerol dimycocerosate pdim one of the most abundant outer membrane lipids anderson plays important roles in both defending against host antimicrobial programs camacho et al cox et al murry et al and in evading these programs altogether cambier et al a rousseau et al immediately following infection mycobacteria rely on pdim to evade toll like receptor tlr dependent recruitment of bactericidal monocytes which can clear infection cambier et al b to circumvent the limitations in using genetics to understand virulence lipid function we developed a chemical approach to introduce a clickable semi synthetic pdim onto the cell wall of mycobacterium marinum upon infection of zebrafish we found that pdim rapidly spreads into host epithelial membranes and that this spreading inhibits tlr activation pdims ability to spread into epithelial membranes correlated with its enhanced fluidity afforded by its methyl branched mycocerosic acids additionally pdims affinity for cholesterol promoted its occupation of epithelial membranes treatment of zebrafish with statins cholesterol synthesis inhibitors decreased spreading and provided protection from infection this work establishes that interactions between host and pathogen lipids influence mycobacterial infectivity and suggests the use of statins as tuberculosis preventive therapy by inhibiting pdim spread,several virulence lipid populate outer cell wall pathogenic mycobacteria jackson phthiocerol dimycocerosate pdim one abundant outer membrane lipid anderson play important role defend host antimicrobial program camacho cox murry evade program altogether cambi rousseau immediately follow infection mycobacteria rely pdim evade toll like receptor tlr dependent recruitment bactericidal monocyte clear infection cambi circumvent limitation use genetic understand virulence lipid function develop chemical approach introduce clickable semi synthetic pdim onto cell wall mycobacterium marinum upon infection zebrafish find pdim rapidly spread host epithelial membrane spread inhibits tlr activation pdim ability spread epithelial membrane correlate enhance fluidity afford methyl branch mycocerosic acid additionally pdim affinity cholesterol promote occupation epithelial membrane treatment zebrafish statin cholesterol synthesis inhibitor decrease spread provide protection infection work establish interaction host pathogen lipid influence mycobacterial infectivity suggest use statin tuberculosis preventive therapy inhibit pdim spread

Herein we followed within-host evolution of Mtb clinical isolates in a cohort of patients with delayed Mtb culture conversion. We captured the genetic diversity of both the initial and the last Mtb isolate obtained in each patient, by focusing on minor variants detected as unfixed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To unmask antibiotic tolerant sub-populations, we exposed the last Mtb isolate to rifampicin (RIF) prior to whole genome sequencing analysis. We were able to detect unfixed SNPs within the Mtb isolates for 9/12 patients, and non-synonymous (ns) SNPs in 6/12 patients. Furthermore, RIF exposure revealed 8 additional unfixed nsSNP unlinked to drug resistance. To better understand the dynamics of Mtb micro-diversity during the course of TB, we investigated the variant composition of a persistent Mtb clinical isolate before and after controlled stress experiments chosen to mimic the course of TB disease. A minor variant, featuring a particular mycocerosates profile, became enriched during both RIF exposure and macrophage infection. The variant was associated with drug tolerance and intracellular persistence, consistent with the pharmacological modeling predicting increased risk of treatment failure. A thorough study of such variants, not necessarily linked to canonical drug-resistance and which may be able to promote anti-TB drug tolerance, may be crucial to prevent the subsequent emergence of resistance. Taken together, the present findings support the further exploration of Mtb micro-diversity as a promising tool to detect patients at risk of poorly responding to anti-TB treatment, ultimately allowing improved and personalized TB management.

Here we focused on TB patients with delayed response to treatment and we performed genetic characterization of Mtb isolates to search for sub-populations that may tolerate anti-TB drugs. We found that Mtb cultured from 9/12 patients contained different sub-populations, and in vitro drug exposure revealed 8 other sub-populations, none related to known drug-resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, we characterized a Mtb variant isolated from a sub-population growing in the presence of rifampicin (RIF), a major anti-TB drug. We found that this variant featured a modified lipidic envelope, and that it was able to develop in the presence of RIF and inside human macrophage cells. We performed pharmacological modelling and found that this kind of variant may be related to a poor response to treatment.

10.1101/2020.04.26.057497,A putative genomic map for resistance of Bos indicus cattle in Cameroon to bovine tuberculosis,"Bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) caused by Mycobacterium bovis is a livestock disease of global economic and public health importance. There are currently no effective vaccines available for livestock and so control relies on animal level surveillance and pasteurisation of dairy products. A new alternative control approach is to exploit the genetic variability of the host; recent studies have demonstrated that breeding Bos taurus cattle for increased resistance to bTB is feasible. The utility of such an approach is still unknown for the Bos indicus cattle population. This study aims to assess genetic variation in bTB resistance and the underlying genomic architecture in Bos indicus breeds in Cameroon.

We conducted a cross-sectional study of slaughter cattle in Cameroon and genotyped a sample of 213 cattle. Their genomic diversity was characterised using PCA, hierarchical clustering and admixture analysis. We assessed genetic variation in bTB resistance using heritability analysis and compared quantitative trait loci.

Previous studies had found that breed was an important factor in explaining the epidemiology of bTB, with Fulani cattle appearing to be more susceptible than mixed breeds. However, we show that the apparent phenotypic differences in visual appearance between the breeds was not reflected by clear genomic differences. At the genetic level, cattle belonging to different hierarchical genomic clusters differed in their susceptibility to bTB. There was evidence of a genomic association between M. bovis infection status with specific SNPs.

We highlight the need to understand the challenges faced by livestock in specific settings both in terms of pathogens and the environment, in addition to their intended purpose and how they fit into a defined management system. It is only at this point livestock keepers can then make informed breeding choices, not only for resistance to disease but also for increasing production.",2020-04-26,genetics,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,bovine tuberculosis btb caused by mycobacterium bovis is a livestock disease of global economic and public health importance there are currently no effective vaccines available for livestock and so control relies on animal level surveillance and pasteurisation of dairy products a new alternative control approach is to exploit the genetic variability of the host recent studies have demonstrated that breeding bos taurus cattle for increased resistance to btb is feasible the utility of such an approach is still unknown for the bos indicus cattle population this study aims to assess genetic variation in btb resistance and the underlying genomic architecture in bos indicus breeds in cameroon we conducted a cross sectional study of slaughter cattle in cameroon and genotyped a sample of cattle their genomic diversity was characterised using pca hierarchical clustering and admixture analysis we assessed genetic variation in btb resistance using heritability analysis and compared quantitative trait loci previous studies had found that breed was an important factor in explaining the epidemiology of btb with fulani cattle appearing to be more susceptible than mixed breeds however we show that the apparent phenotypic differences in visual appearance between the breeds was not reflected by clear genomic differences at the genetic level cattle belonging to different hierarchical genomic clusters differed in their susceptibility to btb there was evidence of a genomic association between m bovis infection status with specific snps we highlight the need to understand the challenges faced by livestock in specific settings both in terms of pathogens and the environment in addition to their intended purpose and how they fit into a defined management system it is only at this point livestock keepers can then make informed breeding choices not only for resistance to disease but also for increasing production,bovine tuberculosis btb cause mycobacterium bovis livestock disease global economic public health importance currently effective vaccine available livestock control rely animal level surveillance pasteurisation dairy product new alternative control approach exploit genetic variability host recent study demonstrate breed bos taurus cattle increase resistance btb feasible utility approach still unknown bos indicus cattle population study aim assess genetic variation btb resistance underlie genomic architecture bos indicus breeds cameroon conduct cross sectional study slaughter cattle cameroon genotype sample cattle genomic diversity characterise use pca hierarchical clustering admixture analysis assess genetic variation btb resistance use heritability analysis compare quantitative trait loci previous study find breed important factor explain epidemiology btb fulani cattle appear susceptible mixed breed however show apparent phenotypic difference visual appearance breed reflect clear genomic difference genetic level cattle belong different hierarchical genomic cluster differ susceptibility btb evidence genomic association bovis infection status specific snps highlight need understand challenge face livestock specific setting term pathogen environment addition intend purpose fit define management system point livestock keeper make informed breeding choice resistance disease also increase production
10.1101/2019.12.21.885723,Multiple merger genealogies in outbreaks of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,"The Kingman coalescent and its developments are often considered among the most important advances in population genetics of the last decades. Demographic inference based on coalescent theory has been used to reconstruct the population dynamics and evolutionary history of several species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), an important human pathogen causing tuberculosis. One key assumption of the Kingman coalescent is that the number of descendants of different individuals does not vary strongly, and violating this assumption could lead to severe biases caused by model misspecification. Individual lineages of MTB are expected to vary strongly in reproductive success because 1) MTB is potentially under constant selection due to the pressure of the host immune system and of antibiotic treatment, 2) MTB undergoes repeated population bottlenecks when it transmits from one host to the next, and 3) some hosts show much higher transmission rates compared to the average (""super-spreaders"").

Here we used an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach to test whether multiple merger coalescents (MMC), a class of models that allow for large variation in reproductive success among lineages, are more appropriate models to study MTB populations. We considered eleven publicly available whole genome sequence data sets sampled from local MTB populations and outbreaks, and found that MMC had a better fit compared to the Kingman coalescent for ten of the eleven data sets. These results indicate that the null model for analyzing MTB outbreaks should be reassessed, and that past findings based on the Kingman coalescent need to be revisited.",2020-01-11,evolutionary biology,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,the kingman coalescent and its developments are often considered among the most important advances in population genetics of the last decades demographic inference based on coalescent theory has been used to reconstruct the population dynamics and evolutionary history of several species including mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb an important human pathogen causing tuberculosis one key assumption of the kingman coalescent is that the number of descendants of different individuals does not vary strongly and violating this assumption could lead to severe biases caused by model misspecification individual lineages of mtb are expected to vary strongly in reproductive success because mtb is potentially under constant selection due to the pressure of the host immune system and of antibiotic treatment mtb undergoes repeated population bottlenecks when it transmits from one host to the next and some hosts show much higher transmission rates compared to the average super spreaders here we used an approximate bayesian computation approach to test whether multiple merger coalescents mmc a class of models that allow for large variation in reproductive success among lineages are more appropriate models to study mtb populations we considered eleven publicly available whole genome sequence data sets sampled from local mtb populations and outbreaks and found that mmc had a better fit compared to the kingman coalescent for ten of the eleven data sets these results indicate that the null model for analyzing mtb outbreaks should be reassessed and that past findings based on the kingman coalescent need to be revisited,kingman coalescent development often consider among important advance population genetic last decade demographic inference base coalescent theory use reconstruct population dynamic evolutionary history several specie include mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb important human pathogen cause tuberculosis one key assumption kingman coalescent number descendant different individual vary strongly violate assumption could lead severe bias cause model misspecification individual lineage mtb expect vary strongly reproductive success mtb potentially constant selection due pressure host immune system antibiotic treatment mtb undergo repeat population bottleneck transmit one host next host show much high transmission rate compare average super spreader use approximate bayesian computation approach test whether multiple merger coalescent mmc class model allow large variation reproductive success among lineage appropriate model study mtb population consider eleven publicly available whole genome sequence data set sample local mtb population outbreak find mmc well fit compare kingman coalescent ten eleven datum set result indicate null model analyze mtb outbreak reassess past finding base kingman coalescent need revisit

10.1101/2020.01.21.913418,PathExt: a general framework for path-based mining of omics-integrated biological networks,"MotivationLarge scale transcriptomic data are routinely used to prioritize genes underlying specific phenotypes. Current approaches largely focus on differentially expressed genes (DEGs), despite the recognition that phenotypes emerge via a network of interactions between genes and proteins, many of which may not be differentially expressed. Furthermore, many practical applications lack sufficient samples or an appropriate control to robustly identify statistically significant DEGs.

ResultsWe provide a computational tool - PathExt, which, in contrast to differential genes, identifies differentially active paths when a control is available, and most active paths otherwise, in an omics-integrated biological network. The sub-network comprising such paths, referred to as the Top-Net, captures the most relevant genes and processes underlying the specific biological context. The TopNet forms a well-connected graph, reflecting the tight orchestration in biological systems. Two key advantages of PathExt are (i) it can extract characteristic genes and pathways even when only a single sample is available, and (ii) it can be used to study a system even in the absence of an appropriate control. We demonstrate the utility of PathExt via two diverse sets of case studies, to characterize (a) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) response upon exposure to 18 antibacterial drugs where only one transcriptomic sample is available for each exposure; and (b) tissue-relevant genes and processes using transcriptomic data from GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) for 39 human tissues. Overall, PathExt is a general tool for prioritizing context-relevant genes in any omics-integrated biological network for any condition(s) of interest, even with a single sample or in the absence of appropriate controls.

Disease is modulated by interbacterial interactions as well as bacterial-host cell interactions resulting in microbial growth, phagocytic attack and secretion of host antimicrobial factors. To overcome the limited ability to manipulate these infection sites, we established a system for Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Yptb) growth in microfluidics-driven microdroplets that regenerates microbial social behavior in tissues. Chemical generation of nitric oxide (NO) in the absence of immune cells was sufficient to reconstruct microbial social behavior, as witnessed by expression of the NO-inactivating protein Hmp on the extreme periphery of microcolonies, mimicking spatial regulation in tissues. Similarly, activated macrophages that expressed inducible NO synthase (iNOS) drove peripheral expression of Hmp, allowing regeneration of social behavior observed in tissues.

10.1101/2020.03.31.018390,EXPRESSION OF Mycobacterium tuberculosis RpsA IN Mycobacterium smegmatis INCREASES SUSCEPTIBILITY TO PYRAZINAMIDE,"Pyrazinamide (PZA) is one of the most important drugs used in combined antituberculous therapy. After the drug enters Mycobacterium tuberculosis it is hydrolyzed by pyrazinamidase (PZAse) to the bactericidal molecule pyrazinoic acid (POA). Ribosomal protein S1 (RpsA) was recently identified as a possible target of PZA based on its binding activity to POA and capacity to inhibit trans-translation. However, its role is not completely understood.

It has been proposed that Mycobacterium smegmatis RpsA is not capable of binding POA, unlike M. tuberculosis RpsA. This may be due to the different amino acid sequence in the carboxy-terminal region of the two molecules: in M. smegmatis RpsA it is much closer to the sites that may interact with POA than in M. tuberculosis RpsA. These differences could be contributing, along with the presence of highly active POA efflux, to the natural resistance to PZA in M. smegmatis.

To further understand the mechanisms of action of PZA and the role of RpsA in PZA susceptibility, we evaluated the effect of complementing M. tuberculosis RpsA expression in M. smegmatis using pNIT mycobacterial non-integrative expression vector and then performed a PZA susceptibility test determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of PZA. It was expected that chimeric ribosomes comprising M. tuberculosis RpsA may be present and may affect PZA susceptibility.

10.1101/828533,TRIM14 is a key regulator of the type I interferon response during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection,"Tripartite motif-containing proteins (TRIMs) play a variety of recently described roles in innate immunity. While many TRIMs regulate type I interferon (IFN) expression following cytosolic nucleic acid sensing of viruses, their contribution to innate immune signaling and gene expression during bacterial infection remains largely unknown. Because Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a potent activator of cGAS-dependent cytosolic DNA sensing, we set out to investigate a role for TRIM proteins in regulating macrophage responses to M. tuberculosis. Here we demonstrate that TRIM14, a non-canonical TRIM that lacks an E3 ligase RING domain, is a critical negative regulator of the type I IFN response in macrophages. We show that TRIM14 physically interacts with both cGAS and TBK1 and that macrophages lacking TRIM14 dramatically hyperinduce interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression following cytosolic nucleic acid transfection, IFN-{beta} treatment, and M. tuberculosis infection. Consistent with a defect in resolution of the type I IFN response, Trim14 knockout (KO) macrophages have more phospho-Ser754 STAT3 relative to phospho-727 and fail to upregulate the STAT3 target Socs3 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3), which is required to turn off IFNAR signaling. These data support a model whereby TRIM14 acts as a scaffold between TBK1 and STAT3 to promote phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser727 and enhance negative regulation of ISG expression. Remarkably, Trim14 KO macrophages hyperinduce antimicrobials like Inos2 and are significantly better than control cells at limiting M. tuberculosis replication. Collectively, these data reveal a previously unappreciated role for TRIM14 in resolving type I IFN responses and controlling M. tuberculosis infection.",2020-01-14,immunology,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,tripartite motif containing proteins trims play a variety of recently described roles in innate immunity while many trims regulate type i interferon ifn expression following cytosolic nucleic acid sensing of viruses their contribution to innate immune signaling and gene expression during bacterial infection remains largely unknown because mycobacterium tuberculosis is a potent activator of cgas dependent cytosolic dna sensing we set out to investigate a role for trim proteins in regulating macrophage responses to m tuberculosis here we demonstrate that trim a non canonical trim that lacks an e ligase ring domain is a critical negative regulator of the type i ifn response in macrophages we show that trim physically interacts with both cgas and tbk and that macrophages lacking trim dramatically hyperinduce interferon stimulated gene isg expression following cytosolic nucleic acid transfection ifn beta treatment and m tuberculosis infection consistent with a defect in resolution of the type i ifn response trim knockout ko macrophages have more phospho ser stat relative to phospho and fail to upregulate the stat target socs suppressor of cytokine signaling which is required to turn off ifnar signaling these data support a model whereby trim acts as a scaffold between tbk and stat to promote phosphorylation of stat at ser and enhance negative regulation of isg expression remarkably trim ko macrophages hyperinduce antimicrobials like inos and are significantly better than control cells at limiting m tuberculosis replication collectively these data reveal a previously unappreciated role for trim in resolving type i ifn responses and controlling m tuberculosis infection,tripartite motif contain protein trim play variety recently describe role innate immunity many trim regulate type interferon ifn expression follow cytosolic nucleic acid sense virus contribution innate immune signal gene expression bacterial infection remain largely unknown mycobacterium tuberculosis potent activator cgas dependent cytosolic dna sensing set investigate role trim protein regulate macrophage response tuberculosis demonstrate trim non canonical trim lack ligase ring domain critical negative regulator type ifn response macrophage show trim physically interact cgas tbk macrophage lack trim dramatically hyperinduce interferon stimulate gene isg expression follow cytosolic nucleic acid transfection ifn beta treatment tuberculosis infection consistent defect resolution type ifn response trim knockout macrophage phospho s stat relative phospho fail upregulate stat target soc suppressor cytokine signal require turn ifnar signal datum support model whereby trim act scaffold tbk stat promote phosphorylation stat ser enhance negative regulation isg expression remarkably trim macrophage hyperinduce antimicrobial like ino significantly well control cell limit tuberculosis replication collectively datum reveal previously unappreciated role trim resolve type ifn response control tuberculosis infection
10.1101/2020.01.16.909523,PE5-PPE4-EspG3 trimer structure from mycobacterial ESX-3 secretion system gives insight into cognate substrate recognition by ESX systems,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has evolved numerous type VII secretion (ESX) systems to secrete multiple factors important for both growth and virulence across their cell envelope. Three such systems; ESX-1, ESX-3, and ESX-5; have been shown to each secrete a unique set of substrates. A large class of these substrates secreted by these three systems are the PE and PPE families of proteins. Proper secretion of the PE-PPE proteins requires the presence of EspG, with each system encoding its own unique copy. There is no cross-talk between any of the ESX systems and how each EspG is recognizing its subset of PE-PPE proteins is currently unknown. The only current structural characterization of PE-PPE-EspG trimers is from the ESX-5 system. Here we present the crystal structure of the PE5mt-PPE4mt-EspG3mm trimer, from the ESX-3 system. Our trimer reveals that EspG3mm interacts exclusively with PPE4mt in a similar manner to EspG5, shielding the hydrophobic tip of PPE4mt from solvent. The C-terminal helical domain of EspG3mm is dynamic, alternating between an  open and  closed form, and this movement is likely functionally relevant in the unloading of PE-PPE heterodimers at the secretion machinery. In contrast to the previously solved ESX-5 trimers, the PE-PPE heterodimer of our ESX-3 trimer is interacting with its chaperone at a drastically different angle, and presents different faces of the PPE protein to the chaperone. We conclude that the PPE-EspG interface from each ESX system has a unique shape complementarity that allows each EspG to discriminate amongst non-cognate PE-PPE pairs.",2020-01-17,biochemistry,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb has evolved numerous type vii secretion esx systems to secrete multiple factors important for both growth and virulence across their cell envelope three such systems esx esx and esx have been shown to each secrete a unique set of substrates a large class of these substrates secreted by these three systems are the pe and ppe families of proteins proper secretion of the pe ppe proteins requires the presence of espg with each system encoding its own unique copy there is no cross talk between any of the esx systems and how each espg is recognizing its subset of pe ppe proteins is currently unknown the only current structural characterization of pe ppe espg trimers is from the esx system here we present the crystal structure of the pe mt ppe mt espg mm trimer from the esx system our trimer reveals that espg mm interacts exclusively with ppe mt in a similar manner to espg shielding the hydrophobic tip of ppe mt from solvent the c terminal helical domain of espg mm is dynamic alternating between an open and closed form and this movement is likely functionally relevant in the unloading of pe ppe heterodimers at the secretion machinery in contrast to the previously solved esx trimers the pe ppe heterodimer of our esx trimer is interacting with its chaperone at a drastically different angle and presents different faces of the ppe protein to the chaperone we conclude that the ppe espg interface from each esx system has a unique shape complementarity that allows each espg to discriminate amongst non cognate pe ppe pairs,mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb evolve numerous type vii secretion esx system secrete multiple factor important growth virulence across cell envelope three system esx esx esx show secrete unique set substrate large class substrate secrete three system ppe family protein proper secretion ppe protein require presence espg system encode unique copy cross talk esx system espg recognize subset ppe protein currently unknown current structural characterization ppe espg trimer esx system present crystal structure ppe espg trimer esx system trimer reveal espg interact exclusively ppe similar manner espg shielding hydrophobic tip ppe solvent terminal helical domain espg dynamic alternating open close form movement likely functionally relevant unload ppe heterodimers secretion machinery contrast previously solve esx trimer ppe heterodimer esx trimer interact chaperone drastically different angle present different face ppe protein chaperone conclude ppe espg interface esx system unique shape complementarity allow espg discriminate amongst non cognate ppe pair

Here we show that serine protease (Rv3194c) promotes mycobacterial infection to lung epithelial through its hyaluronic acid (HA)-binding site. Both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that Rv3194c bound to HA. Utilizing synthetic peptides, we next defined HA-binding site of 20 amino acids from 91 to 110 of Rv3194c (P91-110). Immunofluorescence assay and an FACScan showed that Rv3194c was interacted with A549 cells (human lung epithelial cells), and its interaction was abolished by the addition of hyaluronidase or P91-110. Experimental infection in Vitro revealed that Rv3194c participates in attachment of recombinant Mycobacterium smegmatis (Rv3194c/MS) to A549 cells, and P91-110 treatment of A549 cells almost inhibited Rv3194c/MS-A549 cells interaction. To provide in vivo evidence, we constructed a reporter strain of M. smegmatis expressed a derivative of the firefly luciferase that is shifted to red (FFlucRT) in combination with Rv3194c (Rv3194c+FFlucRT/MS) to infect the rodents and monitor the progression of the disease. Using bioluminescence imaging and bacterial counts in lung tissue confirmed that Rv3194c dramatically enhanced the persistence of M. smegmatis. In addition, treatment of intratracheal Rv3194c+FFlucRT/MS-infected mice with P91-110 significantly suppressed the growth of Rv3194c+FFlucRT/MS in vivo.

10.1101/358986,"Structure-aware M. tuberculosis functional annotation uncloaks resistance, metabolic, and virulence genes","Accurate and timely functional genome annotation is essential for translating basic pathogen research into clinically impactful advances. Here, through literature curation and structure-function inference, we systematically update the functional genome annotation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis virulent type strain H37Rv. First, we systematically curated annotations for 589 genes from 662 publications, including 282 gene products absent from leading databases. Second, we modeled 1,711 under-annotated proteins and developed a semi-automated pipeline that captured shared function between 400 protein models and structural matches of known function on protein data bank, including drug efflux proteins, metabolic enzymes, and virulence factors. In aggregate, these structure- and literature-derived annotations update 940/1,725 under-annotated H37Rv genes and generate hundreds of functional hypotheses. Retrospectively applying the annotation to a recent whole-genome transposon mutant screen provided missing function for 48% (13/27) of under-annotated genes altering antibiotic efficacy and 33% (23/69) required for persistence during mouse TB infection. Prospective application of the protein models enabled us to functionally interpret novel laboratory generated Pyrazinamide-resistant (PZA) mutants of unknown function, which implicated the emerging Coenzyme A depletion model of PZA action in the mutants PZA resistance. Our findings demonstrate the functional insight gained by integrating structural modeling and systematic literature curation, even for widely studied microorganisms.

10.1101/2020.02.03.933101,An isothermal method for sensitive detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complexes using CRISPR/Cas12a cis- and trans-cleavage,"Tuberculosis is still one of the most serious infectious diseases resulting in lethal death worldwide. The traditional method is still not enough to meet the clinical requirements of rapid diagnosis, high specificity and sensitivity. Fast, sensitive and accurate detection of mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is an urgent need for the treatment and control of tuberculosis disease. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-associated proteins (Cas12a) exhibits strongly nonspecific degradation ability of exogenous single-strand nucleic acid (trans-cleavage) after specific recognition of target sequence. We purified Cas12a protein and selected a proper guide RNA (gRNA) based on conserved sequences of MTB from gRNA library we designed. Then, we proposed a novel method based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and CRISPR/Cas12a nuclease system for specific and sensitive detection of MTB DNA. The assay based on fluorescence detection pattern showed 4.48 fM of limit of detection (LOD) and good linear correlation of concentration and fluorescence value (R2=0.9775). Also, it showed good performance in distinguishing other bacteria. Furthermore, its clinical performance was evaluated by 193 samples and showed sensitivity of 99.29% (139/140) and specificity of 100% (53/53) at 99% confidence interval, respectively, compared with culture method.

Yet, the responsible mechanisms remain elusive. Macrophage activation towards the microbicidal (M1) program depends on the HIF-1 -mediated metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation towards glycolysis. Here, we asked whether a tuberculosis (TB) microenvironment changes the M1 macrophage metabolic state. We exposed M1 macrophages to the acellular fraction of tuberculous pleural effusions (TB-PE), and found lower glycolytic activity, accompanied by elevated levels of oxidative phosphorylation and bacillary load, compared to controls. The host-derived lipid fraction of TB-PE drove these metabolic alterations. HIF-1 stabilization reverted the effect of TB-PE by restoring M1 metabolism. As a proof-of-concept, Mtb-infected mice with stabilized HIF-1 displayed lower bacillary loads and a pronounced M1-like metabolic profile in alveolar macrophages. Collectively, we demonstrate that host-derived lipids from a TB-associated microenvironment alter the M1 macrophage metabolic reprogramming by hampering HIF-1 functions, thereby impairing control of Mtb infection.",2020-03-25,immunology,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb regulates the macrophage metabolic state to thrive in the host yet the responsible mechanisms remain elusive macrophage activation towards the microbicidal m program depends on the hif mediated metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation towards glycolysis here we asked whether a tuberculosis tb microenvironment changes the m macrophage metabolic state we exposed m macrophages to the acellular fraction of tuberculous pleural effusions tb pe and found lower glycolytic activity accompanied by elevated levels of oxidative phosphorylation and bacillary load compared to controls the host derived lipid fraction of tb pe drove these metabolic alterations hif stabilization reverted the effect of tb pe by restoring m metabolism as a proof of concept mtb infected mice with stabilized hif displayed lower bacillary loads and a pronounced m like metabolic profile in alveolar macrophages collectively we demonstrate that host derived lipids from a tb associated microenvironment alter the m macrophage metabolic reprogramming by hampering hif functions thereby impairing control of mtb infection,mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb regulate macrophage metabolic state thrive host yet responsible mechanism remain elusive macrophage activation towards microbicidal program depend hif mediate metabolic shift oxidative phosphorylation towards glycolysis ask whether tuberculosis microenvironment change macrophage metabolic state expose macrophage acellular fraction tuberculous pleural effusion find low glycolytic activity accompany elevated level oxidative phosphorylation bacillary load compare control host derive lipid fraction drive metabolic alteration hif stabilization revert effect restore metabolism proof concept mtb infect mouse stabilize hif display low bacillary load pronounce like metabolic profile alveolar macrophage collectively demonstrate host derive lipid associate microenvironment alter macrophage metabolic reprogramme hamper hif function thereby impair control mtb infection
10.1101/2020.04.28.067090,Investigation of the anti-TB potential of selected alkaloid constituents using molecular docking approach,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the leading bacterial killer disease worldwide, causes Human tuberculosis (TB). Due to the growing problem of drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, new anti-TB drugs are urgently needed. Natural sources such as plant extracts have long played an important role in tuberculosis management and can be used as a template to design new drugs. A wide screening of natural sources is time consuming but the process can be significantly sped up using molecular docking. In this study, we used a molecular docking approach to investigate the interactions between selected natural constituents and three proteins MtPanK, MtDprE1 and MtKasA involved in the physiological functions of Mycobacterium tuberculosis which are necessary for the bacteria to survive and cause disease. The molecular docking score, a score that accounts for the binding affinity between a ligand and a target protein, for each protein was calculated against 150 chemical constituents of different classes to estimate the binding free energy. The docking scores represent the binding free energy. The best docking scores indicates the highest ligand protein binding which is indicated by the lowest energy value. Among the natural constituents, Shermilamine B showed a docking score of - 8.5kcal/mol, Brachystamide B showed a docking score of -8.6 kcal/mol with MtPanK, Monoamphilectine A showed a score of -9.8kcal/mol with MtDprE1.These three compounds showed docking scores which were superior to the control inhibitors and represent the opportunity of in vitro biological evaluation and anti-TB drug design. Consequently, all these compounds belonged to the alkaloid class. Specific interactions were studied to further understand the nature of intermolecular bonds between the most active ligands and the protein binding site residues which proved that among the constituents monoamphilectine A and Shermilamine B show more promise as Anti-TB drugs. Furthermore, the ADMET properties of these compounds or ligands showed that they have no corrosive or carcinogenic parameters.

10.1101/2020.02.21.959353,SIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis synergy within the granuloma accelerates the reactivation pattern of latent tuberculosis,"Human immunodeficiency virus infection is the most common risk factor for severe forms of tuberculosis (TB), regardless of CD4 T cell count. Using a well-characterized cynomolgus macaque model of human TB, we compared radiographic, immunologic and microbiologic characteristics of early (subclinical) reactivation of latent M. tuberculosis (Mtb) infection among animals subsequently infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) or who underwent anti-CD4 depletion by a depletion antibody. CD4 depleted animals had significantly fewer CD4 T cells within granulomas compared to Mtb/SIV co-infected and Mtb-only control animals. After 2 months of treatment, subclinical reactivation occurred at similar rates among CD4 depleted (5 of 7 animals) and SIV infected animals (4 of 8 animals). However, SIV-induced reactivation was associated with more dissemination of lung granulomas that were permissive to Mtb growth resulting in greater bacterial burden within granulomas compared to CD4 depleted reactivators. Granulomas from Mtb/SIV animals displayed a more robust T cell activation profile (IFN-, IFN-{gamma}, TNF, IL-17, IL-2, IL-10, IL-4 and granzyme B) compared to Mtb/CD4 animals and controls though these effectors did not protect against reactivation or dissemination, but instead may be related to increased viral and/or Mtb antigens. SIV replication within the granuloma was associated with reactivation, greater overall Mtb growth and Mtb killing resulting in greater overall Mtb burden. These data support that SIV disrupts protective immune responses against latent Mtb infection beyond the loss of CD4 T cells, and that synergy between SIV and Mtb occurs within granulomas.

Controlled, asymptomatic infection (latent infection) can develop into symptomatic, severe TB (reactivation TB) when the immune system is impaired, and HIV is the most common risk factor. Chronic HIV infection is associated with low CD4 T cells but there are likely other factors involved. Using macaques with latent Mtb infection, we could induce reactivation from either CD4 T cell depletion or SIV infection. We found that SIV induced reactivation was more dramatic with more bacterial dissemination and bacterial growth compared to those with CD4 depletion. While SIV-infected animals had more activated immune responses in the lung granulomas (a collection of immune cells that functions to combat Mtb), they could not prevent bacterial spread of Mtb resulting in more TB pathology, higher bacterial burden and disease throughout the body. These data suggest that the HIV-induced reactivation TB is not solely from the loss of CD4 T cells. Furthermore, our data suggest that SIV and Mtb have a synergistic relationship within granulomas that impairs the ability to kill Mtb and that this relationship exacerbates TB

It is one of the most closely related species to the M. tuberculosis complex. Using M. kansasii as a proxy for the M. kansasii-M. tuberculosis-common ancestor, we asked whether introducing the M. tuberculosis-specific gene pair Rv3377c-Rv3378c into M. kansasii affects the course of experimental infection. Expression of these genes resulted in the production of an adenosine-linked lipid species, known as 1-tuberculosinyladenosine (1-TbAd), but did not alter growth in vitro under standard conditions. Production of 1-TbAd enhanced growth of M. kansasii under acidic conditions through a bacterial cell-intrinsic mechanism independent of controlling pH in the bulk extracellular and intracellular spaces. Production of 1-TbAd led to greater burden of M. kansasii in the lung of C57Bl/6 mice during the first 24 hours after infection and ex vivo infections of alveolar macrophages recapitulated this phenotype within the same time frame. However, in long-term infections, production of 1-TbAd resulted in impaired bacterial survival in both C57Bl/6 mice and Ccr2-/- mice. We have demonstrated that M. kansasii is a valid surrogate of M. tuberculosis to study virulence factors acquired by the latter organism, yet shown the challenge inherent to studying the complex evolution of mycobacterial pathogenicity with isolated gene complementation.

IMPORTANCEThis work sheds light on the role of the lipid 1-tuberculosinyladenosine in the evolution of an environmental ancestor to M. tuberculosis.

Mycobacterial infections such as Tuberculosis (TB) and Non-Tuberculosis infections have seen a significant increase in the incidence of multi-drug resistant and extensively drug-resistant infections. With this increase in drug-resistant Mycobacteria, mycobacteriophage therapy offers a promising alternative. However, a comprehensive study on the infection dynamics of mycobacteriophage against their host bacteria and the evolution of bacteriophage (phage) resistance in the bacteria remains elusive. We aim to study the infection dynamics of a phage cocktail against Mycobacteria under various pathophysiological conditions such as low pH, low growth rate and hypoxia. We show that mycobacteriophages are effective against M. smegmatis under various conditions and the phage cocktail prevents emergence of resistance for long durations. Although the phages are able to amplify after infection, the initial multiplicity of infection plays an important role in reducing the bacterial growth and prolonging efficacy. Mycobacteriophages are effective against antibiotic-resistant strains of Mycobacterium and show synergy with antibiotics such as rifampicin and isoniazid. Finally, we also show that mycobacteriophages are efficient against M. tuberculosis both under lag and log phase for several weeks. These findings have important implications for developing phage therapy for Mycobacterium.",2020-05-17,microbiology,Tuberculosis,Tuberculosis,antibiotic resistance continues to be a major global health risk with an increase in multi drug resistant infections seen across nearly all bacterial diseases mycobacterial infections such as tuberculosis tb and non tuberculosis infections have seen a significant increase in the incidence of multi drug resistant and extensively drug resistant infections with this increase in drug resistant mycobacteria mycobacteriophage therapy offers a promising alternative however a comprehensive study on the infection dynamics of mycobacteriophage against their host bacteria and the evolution of bacteriophage phage resistance in the bacteria remains elusive we aim to study the infection dynamics of a phage cocktail against mycobacteria under various pathophysiological conditions such as low ph low growth rate and hypoxia we show that mycobacteriophages are effective against m smegmatis under various conditions and the phage cocktail prevents emergence of resistance for long durations although the phages are able to amplify after infection the initial multiplicity of infection plays an important role in reducing the bacterial growth and prolonging efficacy mycobacteriophages are effective against antibiotic resistant strains of mycobacterium and show synergy with antibiotics such as rifampicin and isoniazid finally we also show that mycobacteriophages are efficient against m tuberculosis both under lag and log phase for several weeks these findings have important implications for developing phage therapy for mycobacterium,antibiotic resistance continue major global health risk increase multi drug resistant infection see across nearly bacterial disease mycobacterial infection tuberculosis non tuberculosis infection see significant increase incidence multi drug resistant extensively drug resistant infection increase drug resistant mycobacteria mycobacteriophage therapy offer promise alternative however comprehensive study infection dynamic mycobacteriophage host bacteria evolution bacteriophage phage resistance bacteria remain elusive aim study infection dynamic phage cocktail mycobacteria various pathophysiological condition low low growth rate hypoxia show mycobacteriophage effective smegmatis various condition phage cocktail prevent emergence resistance long duration although phage able amplify infection initial multiplicity infection play important role reduce bacterial growth prolong efficacy mycobacteriophage effective antibiotic resistant strain mycobacterium show synergy antibiotic rifampicin isoniazid finally also show mycobacteriophage efficient tuberculosis lag log phase several week finding important implication develop phage therapy mycobacterium

Yet how sequences of IDPs code for their conformational dynamics is poorly understood. Here we combined NMR spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize the conformations and dynamics of ChiZ1-64. This IDP is the N-terminal fragment (residues 1-64) of the transmembrane protein ChiZ, a component of the cell division machinery in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Its N-half contains most of the prolines and all of the anionic residues while the C-half most of the glycines and cationic residues. MD simulations, first validated by SAXS and secondary chemical shift data, found scant -helices or {beta}-strands but considerable propensity for polyproline II (PPII) torsion angles. Importantly, several blocks of residues (e.g., 11-29) emerge as ""correlated segments"", identified by frequent formation of PPII stretches, salt bridges, cation-{pi} interactions, and sidechain-backbone hydrogen bonds. NMR relaxation experiments showed non-uniform transverse relaxation rates (R2s) and nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOEs) along the sequence (e.g., high R2s and NOEs for residues 11-14 and 23-28). MD simulations further revealed that the extent of segmental correlation is sequence-dependent: segments where internal interactions are more prevalent manifest elevated ""collective"" motions on the 5-10 ns timescale and suppressed local motions on the sub-ns timescale. Amide proton exchange rates provides corroboration, with residues in the most correlated segment exhibiting the highest protection factors.

In this study we considered abnormal retention of filamentous actin on early phagosomes contributing to defective phagosome acidification. The actin depolymerizing protein cofilin1 was found downregulated in macrophages infected with virulent M. tuberculosis. Also, phosphocofilin1, the inactive form of cofilin1, which leads to retention of filamentous actin, and the total filamentous actin itself were found upregulated in macrophages infected with virulent M. tuberculosis. Over expression of constitutively active cofilin1 in macrophages was found to decrease the level of filamentous actin and increase phagosome acidification when infected with virulent M. tuberculosis. The anticancer drug sorafenib which activates cofilin1 in PI3K dependent manner was also found to decrease the filamentous actin level and increase phagosome acidification. Cofilin1, known to be positively regulated by superoxide was found to be downregulated by ESAT-6 of M. tuberculosis where the latter is known to reduce ROS in macrophages. Ectopic expression of ESAT-6 in macrophages was found to downregulate cofilin1, increase filamentous actin and to transform the macrophages more spindle shaped.

With the aim of harnessing the host response in providing support to existing regimens, we used sertraline (SRT) to stunt the pro-pathogenic type I IFN response of macrophages to infection. While SRT alone could only arrest bacterial growth, it effectively escalated the bactericidal activities of Isoniazid (H) and Rifampicin (R) in macrophages. This strengthening of antibiotic potencies by SRT was more evident in conditions of ineffective control by these frontline TB drug, against tolerant strains or dormant Mtb. SRT, could significantly combine with standard TB drugs to enhance early pathogen clearance from tissues of mice infected with either drug sensitive/ tolerant strains of Mtb. Further, we demonstrate an enhanced protection in acute TB infection of the highly susceptible C3HeB/FeJ mice with the combination therapy signifying the use of SRT as a potent adjunct to standard TB therapeutic regimens against bacterial populations of diverse physiology.

To address this challenge, we developed a high-throughput functional genomics approach combining inducible CRISPR-interference and image-based analyses of morphological features and sub-cellular molecular localizations in the related non-pathogen, M. smegmatis. Applying automated imaging and analysis to an arrayed library of 272 essential gene knockdown mutants, we derive robust, quantitative descriptions of bacillary morphologies consequent on gene silencing. Leveraging statistical-learning, we demonstrate that functionally related genes cluster by morphotypic similarity and that this information can be used to infer gene function. Exploiting this observation, we reveal a previously unknown restriction-modification system, and identify filamentation as a defining mycobacterial response to histidine starvation.

To achieve this, they are secreted, bind surface receptors to induce endocytosis and translocate a catalytic unit into the cytosol to intoxicate host cells. A three-dimensional structure that provides insight into the underlying mechanisms is still lacking. Here, we determined the crystal structure of full-length Yersinia pseudotuberculosis CNFY. CNFY consists of five domains (D1-D5), and by integrating structural and functional data we demonstrate that D1-3 act as export and translocation module for the catalytic unit (D4-5) or fused {beta}-lactamase reporter proteins. We further found that domain D4, which possesses structural similarity to ADP-ribosyl transferases, but had no equivalent catalytic activity, changed its position to interact extensively with D5 in the crystal structure of the free D4-5 fragment. This liberates D5 from a semi-blocked conformation in full-length CNFY, leading to higher deamidation activity.
